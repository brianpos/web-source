# US Quality Core Observation Screening Assessment - 2026 US Quality Core Implementation Guide v0.5.0

## Resource Profile: US Quality Core Observation Screening Assessment 

 
The US Quality Core Observation Screening Assessment Profile is based upon the US Core Observation Screening Assessment Profile which can be used to represent individual responses, panels of multi-question surveys, and multi-select responses to “check all that apply” questions. The US Quality Core Observation Survey Profile sets minimum expectations for the Observation Resource to record, search, and fetch retrieve observations that represent the questions and responses to form/survey and defines the core set of elements and extensions for quality rule and measure authors. 

### USCDI+ Quality Element Support Expectations

Systems are expected to support this profile as part of implementing USCDI+ Quality V1 in FHIR and meeting the conformance requirements of this guide.

The following elements are specifically relevant to USCDI+ Quality V1 data classes and elements. Systems are expected to support these elements as applicable to their role in US Quality Core data exchange. See the [Must Support](must-support.md) section of this guide for more information. These elements are tagged as (USCDI+ Quality) in the formal profile views.

**USCDI+ Quality Elements:**

* status: (USCDI+ Quality) (USCDI) registered | preliminary | final | amended | corrected | entered-in-error | unknown
* category: (USCDI+ Quality) (USCDI) Classification of type of observation
* code: (USCDI+ Quality) (USCDI) Type of observation (code / type)
* effective[x]: (USCDI+ Quality) (USCDI) Clinically relevant time/time-period for observation
* value[x]: (USCDI+ Quality) (USCDI) Actual result

Because this profile is derived from US Core, systems are also expected to support Must Support requirements and (USCDI) tagged elements inherited from US Core. The [Formal Views](#profile) section also provides the formal summary, definitions, terminology requirements, and mandatory element requirements.

### Profile Specific Implementation Guidance

To represent that an observation of this type intentionally did not occur for a medical, patient, or system reason, use the [US Quality Core Observation Cancelled](StructureDefinition-us-quality-core-observationcancelled.md) profile.

**Usages:**

* Refer to this Profile: [US Quality Core Observation Screening Assessment](StructureDefinition-us-quality-core-observation-screening-assessment.md)
* Examples for this Profile: [Observation/example-screening-assessment-10-minute-apgar-heart-rate](Observation-example-screening-assessment-10-minute-apgar-heart-rate.md)
* CapabilityStatements using this Profile: [US Quality Core Client CapabilityStatement](CapabilityStatement-us-quality-core-client.md) and [US Quality Core Server CapabilityStatement](CapabilityStatement-us-quality-core-server.md)
