# US Quality Core Simple Observation - 2026 US Quality Core Implementation Guide v0.5.0

## Resource Profile: US Quality Core Simple Observation 

 
Profile of Simple Observation for decision support/quality metrics. Defines the core set of elements and extensions for quality rule and measure authors. 

### USCDI+ Quality Element Support Expectations

Systems are expected to support this profile as part of implementing USCDI+ Quality V1 in FHIR and meeting the conformance requirements of this guide.

The following elements are specifically relevant to USCDI+ Quality V1 data classes and elements. Systems are expected to support these elements as applicable to their role in US Quality Core data exchange. See the [Must Support](must-support.md) section of this guide for more information. These elements are tagged as (USCDI+ Quality) in the formal profile views.

**USCDI+ Quality Elements:**

* status: (USCDI+ Quality) (USCDI) registered | preliminary | final | amended | corrected | entered-in-error | unknown
* category: (USCDI+ Quality) (USCDI) Classification of type of observation
* category:us-core: (USCDI+ Quality) (USCDI) US Core classification of type of observation
* code: (USCDI+ Quality) (USCDI) Type of observation (code / type)
* effective[x]: (USCDI+ Quality) (USCDI) Clinically relevant time/time-period for observation
* value[x]: (USCDI+ Quality) (USCDI) Actual result

Because this profile is derived from US Core, systems are also expected to support Must Support requirements and (USCDI) tagged elements inherited from US Core. The [Formal Views](#profile) section also provides the formal summary, definitions, terminology requirements, and mandatory element requirements.

### Profile Specific Implementation Guidance

To represent that an observation intentionally did not occur for a medical, patient, or system reason, use the [US Quality Core Observation Cancelled](StructureDefinition-us-quality-core-observationcancelled.md) profile.

Additional informational guidance for authoring CQL using this profile is provided in the [CQL Authoring Usage (Informational)](#cql-authoring-usage-informational) section of this page.

### Notes:

#### CQL Authoring Usage (Informational)

US Core and US Quality Core define precise profiles for specific observations, as well as a general profile for LOINC-code laboratory result observations. When creating expressions for eCQMs or CDS artifacts with US Quality Core, use the applicable specific profile directly rather than the generic US Quality Core Observation profile when one applies.

To create an expression specifically requesting information that an observation intentionally did not occur for a medical, patient or system reason, use the profile [USQualityCore Observation Cancelled](StructureDefinition-us-quality-core-observationcancelled.md).

The following example illustrates the use of the observation profile.

```
define "Pap Test with Results":
  [Observation: "Pap Test"] PapTest
    where PapTest.value is not null
      and PapTest.status in { 'final', 'amended', 'corrected', 'preliminary' }

```
