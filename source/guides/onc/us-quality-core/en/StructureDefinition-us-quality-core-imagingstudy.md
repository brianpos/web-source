# US Quality Core ImagingStudy - 2026 US Quality Core Implementation Guide v0.5.0

## Resource Profile: US Quality Core ImagingStudy 

 
Profile of ImagingStudy for decision support/quality metrics. Defines the core set of elements and extensions for quality rule and measure authors. 

### USCDI+ Quality Element Support Expectations

This profile does not include USCDI+ Quality flagged elements and is **not in scope** for USCDI+ Quality V1 conformance requirements in this guide. See the [USCDI+ Quality](uscdiquality.md#summary-list-of-in-scope-profiles-for-conformance) page for the list of profiles and elements that are in scope for USCDI+ Quality V1.

This profile is inherited from QI-Core v6.0.0 and is included to ease adoption for systems that currently support QI-Core. Refer to the [Formal Views](#profile) section for the formal summary, definitions, terminology requirements, and mandatory element requirements.

**Usages:**

* Refer to this Profile: [US Quality Core DiagnosticReport Profile for Report and Note Exchange](StructureDefinition-us-quality-core-diagnosticreport-note.md), [US Quality Core NonPatient Observation](StructureDefinition-us-quality-core-nonpatient-observation.md) and [US Quality Core Simple Observation](StructureDefinition-us-quality-core-simple-observation.md)
* Examples for this Profile: [ImagingStudy/example](ImagingStudy-example.md)
