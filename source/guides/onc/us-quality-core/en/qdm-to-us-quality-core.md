# Quality Data Model (QDM) v5.6 to US Quality Core v0.5.0 mapping - 2026 US Quality Core Implementation Guide v0.5.0

## Quality Data Model (QDM) v5.6 to US Quality Core v0.5.0 mapping

The US Quality Core Implementation Guide includes the QDM-to–QI-Core mappings from QI-Core v6.0.0, with minor edits and [errata](https://jira.hl7.org/browse/FHIR-53324).The tables have been updated to reference the corresponding US Quality Core profile and elements. While US Quality Core v0.5.0 has incorporated all QI-Core profiles, not all are required to be implemented as part of the conformance criteria of this guide, as described in the [Summary of Conformance Requirements](general-requirements.md#summary-of-conformance-requirements) and the [USCDI+ Quality in-scope](uscdiquality.md#summary-list-of-in-scope-profiles-for-conformance) and [out-of-scope](uscdiquality.md#summary-list-of-out-of-scope-profiles-for-conformance) profile summaries.

QDM version 5.6 is the current version used by eCQMs since 2024 and thus forms the basis for this mapping.

### Introduction

The CMS Quality Data Model (QDM) has been used to express electronic clinical quality measures (eCQMs) in HQMF since 2012. QDM is a conceptual data model that has evolved based on feedback, testing and use. The current version (Version 5.6 for eCQM implementation 2024, 2025 and 2026) and QDM's complete history can be found on the [eCQI Resource Center](https://ecqi.healthit.gov/qdm). Most of the QDM concepts map directly to US Core 6.1.0, FHIR R4 resources or extensions represented in US Quality Core.

Each mapping table shows the US Quality Core concept in the right-hand column and the corresponding QDM datatype(s) and attributes in the left-hand column. The mapping tables primarily reference the US Quality Core metadata concepts represented in QDM. The tables also include some US Quality Core concepts identified as beneficial by measure developers and implementers; such elements appear in the respective table’s middle column (under US Quality Core) and have no corresponding left-hand column QDM attributes. The effort mapped the intended meaning of each QDM datatype and attribute to a US Quality Core resource metadata element. In some cases, multiple QDM datatypes map to a single US Quality Core. Since QDM is a conceptual data model some of the elements may not have a direct mapping to a US Quality Core profile or one of the items in its respective Key Element Table. Content in the US Quality Core profile Key Element Table tabs is based on US Core 6.1.0 requirements, or directly from FHIR 4.0.1 in the absence of a respective US Core profile.

In addition to the US Quality Core to QDM comparisons presented with each US Quality Core resource, this section of the implementation guide presents the mapping directly from QDM concepts. Thus, the IG provides a view of the mappings in both directions (US Quality Core to QDM, and QDM to US Quality Core). This section is divided into 55 sections, one for each QDM concept, or QDM datatype. Each QDM datatype includes a general description of the concept and a table mapping each of the QDM datatype-related attributes to US Quality Core metadata elements. Refer to the [eCQI Resource Center](https://ecqi.healthit.gov/qdm) for the full QDM 5.6 documentation.

### Adverse Event

QDM defines Adverse Event as any untoward medical occurrence associated with the clinical care delivery, whether or not considered drug related. The concepts aligns with the [FHIR R4 resource Adverse Event.](https://hl7.org/fhir/r4/adverseevent-definitions.html#key_AdverseEvent) The FHIR resource provides clearer expressivity as compared with QDM.

The HL7 Patient Care Workgroup documented some [use cases](https://confluence.hl7.org/display/PC/Adverse+Event+Use+Cases) and [supporting information](https://confluence.hl7.org/display/PC/Adverse+Event+and+consequence) for using this resource; however, most adverse event information is more identifiable in clinical records as findings, conditions, or observations. Thus, measure developers may find more effective information retrieval by using the condition, simple observation, or specific observation profiles to identify triggers indicating potential adverse events. References for information regarding potential adverse event triggers: [CMS Hospital-Acquired Condition Reduction Program.](https://www.cms.gov/medicare/quality-initiatives-patient-assessment-instruments/value-based-programs/hac/hospital-acquired-conditions) Also useful: [Institute for Healthcare Improvement Trigger Tool for Measuring Adverse Drug Events (requires registration)](https://www.ihi.org/resources/Pages/Tools/TriggerToolforMeasuringAdverseDrugEvents.aspx)

Much of the detail about adverse events is present in separate risk management systems based on incident reports rather than the electronic health record (EHR) except for some details in unstructured progress notes. For those using this “Adverse Event” QDM datatype, QDM includes an attribute code that represents the specific type of event that occurred, consistent with [AdverseEvent.event](StructureDefinition-us-quality-core-adverseevent-definitions.md#key_AdverseEvent.event).

QDM does not include an attribute to address the additional elements available in US Quality Core: [AdverseEvent.suspectEntity](StructureDefinition-us-quality-core-adverseevent-definitions.md#diff_AdverseEvent.suspectEntity) (the suspected cause), or the [AdverseEvent.resultingCondition](StructureDefinition-us-quality-core-adverseevent-definitions.md#diff_AdverseEvent.resultingCondition). As an example to differentiate these elements:

* [AdverseEvent.event](StructureDefinition-us-quality-core-adverseevent-definitions.md#diff_AdverseEvent.event) = fall
* [AdverseEvent.resultingCondition](StructureDefinition-us-quality-core-adverseevent-definitions.md#diff_AdverseEvent.resultingCondition) = fracture
* [AdverseEvent.suspectEntity](StructureDefinition-us-quality-core-adverseevent-definitions.md#diff_AdverseEvent.suspectEntity) = area rug

QDM version 5.6 (and earlier versions) only address one of these elements, the event. Therefore, QDM AdverseEvent code maps to AdverseEvent.event. Measure developers seeking to retrieve data about the cause of an AdverseEvent may be able to relate the occurrence timing of a potential causative event and the AdverseEvent.event timing. Further detail about the AdverseEvent will require use of FHIR or potentially a subsequent version of QDM after QDM 5.6.

### Allergy/Intolerance

Allergy is used to address immune-mediated reactions to a substance such as type 1 hypersensitivity reactions, other allergy-like reactions, including pseudo-allergy.

Intolerance is a record of a clinical assessment of a propensity, or a potential risk to an individual, to have a non-immune mediated adverse reaction on future exposure to the specified substance, or class of substance.

| | | |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Allergy/Intolerance | [AllergyIntolerance](StructureDefinition-us-quality-core-allergyintolerance.md) |   |
|   | [AllergyIntolerance.clinicalStatus](StructureDefinition-us-quality-core-allergyintolerance-definitions.md#key_AllergyIntolerance.clinicalStatus) | Identifies if active, inactive, resolved; while not a QDM attribute, this is an important element for retrieving active allergies or intolerances. |
|   | [AllergyIntolerance.type](StructureDefinition-us-quality-core-allergyintolerance-definitions.md#key_AllergyIntolerance.type) | Defines difference between Allergy and Intolerance; while not a QDM attribute, this is an important element for differentiating between allergies and intolerances. |
|   | [AllergyIntolerance.verificationStatus](StructureDefinition-us-quality-core-allergyintolerance-definitions.md#key_AllergyIntolerance.verificationStatus) | Identifies if unconfirmed, confirmed, refuted, entered-in-error; while not a QDM attribute, this is an important element for retrieving confirmed allergies or intolerances. |
|   | [AllergyIntolerance.category](StructureDefinition-us-quality-core-allergyintolerance-definitions.md#key_AllergyIntolerance.category) | Helpful to identify classes of potential allergens such as food, medication, environment, biologic; while not a QDM attribute, this may be a helpful element for some use cases. |
| **QDM Attributes** |   |   |

| prevalencePeriod | [AllergyIntolerance.onset[x]](StructureDefinition-us-quality-core-allergyintolerance-definitions.md#key_AllergyIntolerance.onset[x]) | Prevalence Period start time maps to AllergyIntolerance.onset[x]. Implementers may need to “map” existing allergy onset timings (e.g., day, age, year, etc.) to a corresponding dateTime to allow calculation of measure or CDS expressions. |

|   | [AllergyIntolerance.criticality](StructureDefinition-us-quality-core-allergyintolerance-definitions.md#key_AllergyIntolerance.criticality) | Indicates potential for clinical harm, e.g., low, high, unable-to-assess; not present as an attribute in QDM but may be helpful for some use cases |
| recorder | [AllergyIntolerance.recorder](StructureDefinition-us-quality-core-allergyintolerance-definitions.md#AllergyIntolerance.recorder) | The individual entering the data about the allergy or intolerance. Note this element is included in QDM but it is not included in the Key Element Table for US Quality Core AllergyIntolerance as it does not have a clear use case; i.e., no existing measures or clinical decision support usage requires the recorder or even the asserter of the allergy or intolerance. |

### Assessment

QDM defines Assessment as a resource used to define specific observations that clinicians use to guide treatment of the patient. An assessment can be a single question, or observable entity with an expected response, an organized collection of questions intended to solicit information from patients, providers or other individuals, or a single observable entity that is part of such a collection of questions. US Core 6.1.0 includes a number of specific observation profiles providing greater specificity in defining observations. US Quality Core inherits five of the observation profiles directly from US Core as no additional constraints are necessary:

* [US Core Observation Occupation Profile](http://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/STU6.1/StructureDefinition-us-core-observation-occupation.html)
* [US Core Observation Pregnancy Intent Profile](http://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/STU6.1/StructureDefinition-us-core-observation-pregnancyintent.html)
* [US Core Observation Pregnancy Status Profile ](http://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/STU6.1/StructureDefinition-us-core-observation-pregnancystatus.html)
* [US Core Observation Sexual Orientation Profile](http://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/STU6.1/StructureDefinition-us-core-observation-sexual-orientation.html)
* [US Core Smoking Status Observation Profile](http://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/STU6.1/StructureDefinition-us-core-smokingstatus.html)

US Quality Core derives from QI-Core, which adds additional constraints to the US Core Observation Screening Assessment and the US Core Simple Observation profiles:

* [US Quality Core Observation Screening Assessment Profile](StructureDefinition-us-quality-core-observation-screening-assessment.md) – generally used with for evaluation surveys and assessment tools
* [US Quality Core Simple Observation Profile](StructureDefinition-us-quality-core-simple-observation.md) – represents any type of observation that is not classified as vital signs, laboratory, imaging, or other more specific observation types. For example, gestational age at birth as a standalone observation (i.e., not part of a survey or assessment tool).

#### Assessment, Order

Assessment, Order uses the ServiceRequest resource. The codes for ordering specific observations should reference the code element specified in the respective profiles: US Quality Core Observation Screening Assessment, US Quality Core Simple Observation; US Core Observation Occupation, US Core Observation Pregnancy Intent, US Core Pregnancy Status, US Core Observation Sexual Orientation, or US Core Smoking Status Observation.

| | | |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Assessment, Order** | [ServiceRequest](StructureDefinition-us-quality-core-servicerequest.md) |   |
|   | [ServiceRequest.status](StructureDefinition-us-quality-core-servicerequest-definitions.md#ServiceRequest.status) | Constrain to active, completed. While QDM does not have an attribute comparable to status, as a conceptual model, status is implied by the name “Assessment, Order” and “Assessment, Recommended” datatypes. |
|   | [ServiceRequest.intent](StructureDefinition-us-quality-core-servicerequest-definitions.md#ServiceRequest.intent) | Required to differentiate an order from a recommendation. The intent value set allows such differentiation using “order” for orders and “plan” for recommendation. Constrain only to “order” (include children: original-order, reflex-order, filler-order, instance-order) |
| **QDM Attributes** |   |   |
| Code | [ServiceRequest.code](StructureDefinition-us-quality-core-servicerequest-definitions.md#ServiceRequest.code) | What is requested, extensible binding to[US Core Procedure Codes](http://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/STU6.1/ValueSet-us-core-procedure-code.html) |
| id | [ServiceRequest.id](StructureDefinition-us-quality-core-servicerequest-definitions.md#ServiceRequest.id) |   |
| Reason | [ServiceRequest.reasonCode](StructureDefinition-us-quality-core-servicerequest-definitions.md#ServiceRequest.reasonCode) | Explanation/justification for procedure or service with extensible binding to[US Core Condition Codes](http://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/STU6.1/ValueSet-us-core-condition-code.html) |
| Author dateTime | [ServiceRequest.authoredOn](StructureDefinition-us-quality-core-servicerequest-definitions.md#ServiceRequest.authoredOn) | When the request transitioned to being actionable. |
| Negation Rationale | See Below |   |
| Requester | [ServiceRequest.requester](StructureDefinition-us-quality-core-servicerequest-definitions.md#ServiceRequest.requester) | Although QDM includes this attribute it has not been used in existing measures and a clear use case has not been established. The original purpose for the QDM requester attribute was to designate the individual/organization responsible for reporting the measure results is the same individual/organization that requested the procedure or service. However, clinical software generally tracks the individual user entering data and linking that individual to a clinical role, a specialty, or an organization is not easily accomplished. |

##### Negation Rationale for Assessment, Order

Use [US Quality Core Service Not Requested](StructureDefinition-us-quality-core-servicenotrequested.md) and reference the code element specified in the respective observation profile:

* [ServiceRequest.doNotPerform](StructureDefinition-us-quality-core-servicenotrequested-definitions.md#ServiceRequest.doNotPerform) - with a value of "true" (as implied by the fixed value in the profile)
* [ServiceRequest.status](StructureDefinition-us-quality-core-servicenotrequested-definitions.md#ServiceRequest.status) - With a value of "completed"
* [ServiceRequest.extension:reasonRefused](StructureDefinition-us-quality-core-servicenotrequested-definitions.md#ServiceRequest.extension:reasonRefused) - Use value set [NegationReasonCodes](ValueSet-us-quality-core-negation-reason.md)
* [ServiceRequest.authoredOn](StructureDefinition-us-quality-core-servicenotrequested-definitions.md#ServiceRequest.authoredOn) - dateTime when this was made available
* [ServiceRequest.code.extension:notDoneValueSet](StructureDefinition-us-quality-core-servicenotrequested-definitions.md#ServiceRequest.code.extension:notDoneValueSet) - Use [us-quality-core-notDoneValueSet](StructureDefinition-us-quality-core-notDoneValueSet.md) to indicate the specific ServiceRequest that was not performed

#### Assessment, Performed

QDM defines Assessment as a resource used to define specific observations that clinicians use to guide treatment of the patient. An assessment can be a single question, or observable entity with an expected response, an organized collection of questions intended to solicit information from patients, providers or other individuals, or a single observable entity that is part of such a collection of questions.

"Assessment, Performed" maps to one of several US Quality Core or US Core profiles as applicable for the information desired:

* [US Quality Core Simple Observation Profile](StructureDefinition-us-quality-core-simple-observation.md)
* [US Quality Core Observation Screening Assessment Profile](StructureDefinition-us-quality-core-observation-screening-assessment.md)
* [US Core Observation Occupation Profile](http://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/STU6.1/StructureDefinition-us-core-observation-occupation.html)
* [US Core Observation Pregnancy Intent Profile](http://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/STU6.1/StructureDefinition-us-core-observation-pregnancyintent.html)
* [US Core Observation Pregnancy Status Profile ](http://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/STU6.1/StructureDefinition-us-core-observation-pregnancystatus.html)
* [US Core Observation Sexual Orientation Profile](http://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/STU6.1/StructureDefinition-us-core-observation-sexual-orientation.html)
* [US Core Smoking Status Observation Profile](http://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/STU6.1/StructureDefinition-us-core-smokingstatus.html)

| **Assessment, Performed: General Use Case** | [Observation](StructureDefinition-us-quality-core-simple-observation.md) |   |
|   | [Observation.category](StructureDefinition-us-quality-core-simple-observation-definitions.md#Observation.category) | Category helps to narrow the request to the class of observation required to meet measure intent. Each US Quality Core or US Core profile has a specific binding to concepts appropriate to the respective profile. Note that QDM does not have an attribute comparable to category, the element may be helpful in expressing a quality measure. |
|   | [Observation.status](StructureDefinition-us-quality-core-simple-observation-definitions.md#Observation.status) | Constrain status to - final, amended, corrected. While QDM does not have an attribute comparable to status, as a conceptual model, status is implied by the name “Assessment, Performed” datatype. |
| **QDM Attributes** |   |   |

| method | [Observation.method](StructureDefinition-us-quality-core-simple-observation-definitions.md#Observation.method) | Although QDM includes this attribute it has not been used in existing measures and a clear use case has not been established. Therefore, it is not in the profile Key Elements Table; it can be found in the Snapshot Table tab of the respective profiles. |
| relatedTo | [Observation.basedOn](StructureDefinition-us-quality-core-simple-observation-definitions.md#Observation.basedOn) | Although QDM includes this attribute it has not been used in existing measures and a clear use case has not been established. Therefore, it is not in the profile Key Elements Table; it can be found in the Snapshot Table tab of the respective profiles. |
|   | [Observation.partOf](StructureDefinition-us-quality-core-simple-observation-definitions.md#Observation.partOf) | A larger event of which this particular Observation is a component or step. For example, an observation as part of a procedure. |
|   | [Observation.derivedFrom](StructureDefinition-us-quality-core-simple-observation-definitions.md#Observation.derivedFrom) | Allows reference to the activity that led to the observation. |

| component | [Observation.component](StructureDefinition-us-quality-core-simple-observation-definitions.md#Observation.component) | Although QDM includes this attribute it has not been used in existing measures and a clear use case has not been established. Many measures address components of a panel of simple observations as single elements. Note that the[US Quality Core Observation Screening Assessment Profile](StructureDefinition-us-quality-core-observation-screening-assessment.md)allows reference to components by identifying the parent screening assessment and using the Observation.hasMember element to reference the individual observations within the set. Therefore, component is not in the profile Key Elements Table; it can be found in the Snapshot Table tab of the respective profiles. |
| component.code | [Observation.component.code](StructureDefinition-us-quality-core-simple-observation-definitions.md#Observation.component.code) | See comment about component. |
| component.result | [Observation.component.value[x]](StructureDefinition-us-quality-core-simple-observation-definitions.md#Observation.component.value[x]) | See comment about component. |
| performer | [Observation.performer](StructureDefinition-us-quality-core-simple-observation-definitions.md#Observation.performer) | Although QDM includes this attribute it has not been used in existing measures and a clear use case has not been established. The original purpose for the QDM**performer**attribute was to designate the individual/organization responsible for reporting the measure results is the same individual/organization that performed the observation or task. However, clinical software generally tracks the individual user entering data and linking that individual to a clinical role, a specialty, or an organization is not easily accomplished. |

##### Negation Rationale for Assessment, Performed

Use [US Quality Core Observation Cancelled](StructureDefinition-us-quality-core-observationcancelled.md) and reference the code element specified in the respective observation profile:

* [Observation.status](StructureDefinition-us-quality-core-observationcancelled-definitions.md#Observation.status) - With a value of "cancelled" (as implied by the fixed value in the profile)
* [Observation.extension:notDoneReason](StructureDefinition-us-quality-core-observationcancelled-definitions.md#Observation.extension:notDoneReason) - Use value set [NegationReasonCodes](ValueSet-us-quality-core-negation-reason.md)

* [Observation.code.extension:notDoneValueSet](StructureDefinition-us-quality-core-observationcancelled-definitions.md#Observation.code.extension:notDoneValueSet) - Use [us-quality-core-notDoneValueSet](StructureDefinition-us-quality-core-notDoneValueSet.md) to indicate the specific Observation that was not performed

#### Assessment, Recommended

Assessment, Recommended uses the ServiceRequest resource. The codes for recommending specific observations should reference the code element specified in the respective profile:

* [US Quality Core Simple Observation Profile](StructureDefinition-us-quality-core-simple-observation.md)
* [US Quality Core Observation Screening Assessment Profile](StructureDefinition-us-quality-core-observation-screening-assessment.md)
* [US Core Observation Occupation Profile](http://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/STU6.1/StructureDefinition-us-core-observation-occupation.html)

### Care Experience

QDM defines Care Experience as the understanding and involvement derived from the direct participation of an individual in the maintenance or improvement of health. QDM represents two kinds of care experience: Patient Care Experience and Provider Care Experience. While generally interpreted as patient or provider satisfaction, experience may also represent understanding, involvement and other factors about the care received or given. Most often organizations obtain such information using questionnaires. Use cases are welcome to help provide examples for us of this concept. The Care Experience concept best fits with the FHIR Observation resource.

QDM’s “Care Experience” maps to either one of two US Quality Core profiles, dependent on the type of information desired:

* [US Quality Core Observation Screening Assessment Profile](StructureDefinition-us-quality-core-observation-screening-assessment.md) – generally used with for evaluation surveys and assessment tools; if the care experience information is obtained using a survey, the US Quality Core Observation Screening Assessment Profile is appropriate.
* [US Quality Core Simple Observation Profile](StructureDefinition-us-quality-core-simple-observation.md) – If care experience is expressed as a single finding or observation, the US Quality Core Simple Observation profile is appropriate.

#### Patient Care Experience

QDM “Patient Care Experience” maps to [US Quality Core Observation Screening Assessment Profile](StructureDefinition-us-quality-core-observation-screening-assessment.md) or [US Quality Core Simple Observation](StructureDefinition-us-quality-core-simple-observation.md), as applicable, for the information desired:

The original purpose for the QDM**performer**attribute was to designate the individual/organization responsible for reporting the measure results is the same individual/organization that performed the observation or task. However, clinical software generally tracks the individual user entering data and linking that individual to a clinical role, a specialty, or an organization is not easily accomplished.[US Quality Core Observation Screening Assessment Profile](StructureDefinition-us-quality-core-observation-screening-assessment.md) |

#### Provider Care Experience

QDM “Provider Care Experience” maps to [US Quality Core Observation Screening Assessment Profile](StructureDefinition-us-quality-core-observation-screening-assessment.md) or [US Quality Core Simple Observation](StructureDefinition-us-quality-core-simple-observation.md), as applicable, for the information desired:

However, clinical software generally tracks the individual user entering data and linking that individual to a clinical role, a specialty, or an organization is not easily accomplished. |

### Care Goal

QDM defines Care Goal as a defined target or measure to be achieved in the process of patient care, that is, an expected outcome. A typical goal is expressed as a change in status expected at a defined future time. That change can be an observation represented by other QDM categories (diagnostic tests, laboratory tests, symptoms, etc.) scheduled for some time in the future and with a particular value. A goal can be found in the plan of care (care plan), the structure used by many stakeholders to define the management actions for the various conditions, problems, or issues identified for the target of the plan. This structure, through which the goals and care-planning actions and processes can be organized, planned, communicated, and checked for completion, is represented in QDM as a Record Artifact in which Care Goal is found.

| | | |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Care Goal** | [Goal](StructureDefinition-us-quality-core-goal.md) | Describes the intended objective(s) for a patient, group or organization |
|   | [Goal.achievementStatus](StructureDefinition-us-quality-core-goal-definitions.md#Goal.achievementStatus) | QDM does not include an attribute to determine the status of a goal. US Quality Core inherits US Core and USCDI requirements to include this element that indicates concepts such as proposed, planned, accepted, active, on-hold, completed, cancelled, rejected, entered in error with a required binding to[value set GoalLifecyleStatus](http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/valueset-goal-status.html). |
| **QDM Attributes** |   |   |
| code | [Goal.description](StructureDefinition-us-quality-core-goal-definitions.md#Goal.description) | Code or test describing the goal. Description has an extensible binding to[US Core Goal Codes.](http://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/STU6.1/ValueSet-us-core-goal-description.html) |

| statusDate |   |   |
| targetOutcome | [Goal.target.detail[x]](StructureDefinition-us-quality-core-goal-definitions.md#Goal.target.detail[x]) | US Core 6.1.0 (USCDI) includes target outcome with a due date, but it does not include information about the target outcome. Thus the target outcome nor the target due date is not included in the US Quality Core Key Elements Table. |
| relevantPeriod | [Goal.start[x]](StructureDefinition-us-quality-core-goal-definitions.md#Goal.start[x]) | When the goal pursuit begins. US Core 6.1.0 (USCDI) includes startDate (date) with binding to GoalStartEvent, events that might initiate a goal; examples include admission to hospital, discharge from hospital, completion time of procedure, childbirth. US Quality Core includes the start timing (date) and the triggering event with a preferred binding to[GoalStartEvent.](http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/valueset-goal-start-event.html) |
|   | [Goal.target.due[x]](StructureDefinition-us-quality-core-goal-definitions.md#Goal.target.due[x]) | QDM does not include a target due date for a goal. US Core 6.1.0 (USCDI) and US Quality Core STU 6 include the target due date in their respective profile Key Element Tables. However, likelihood of retrieving a target due date may be limited and those using this element in measure expressions should work with implementers to determine feasibility. |
| statusDate | [Goal.statusDate](StructureDefinition-us-quality-core-goal-definitions.md#Goal.statusDate) | Date when goal status took effect. Neither US Core nor US Quality Core include this element in the Key Elements Table for this profile. |
| relatedTo | [Goal.addresses](StructureDefinition-us-quality-core-goal-definitions.md#Goal.addresses) | Issues addressed by this goal. Neither US Core nor US Quality Core include this element in the Key Elements Table for this profile. |
| performer | [Goal.expressedBy](StructureDefinition-us-quality-core-goal-definitions.md#Goal.expressedBy) | Although QDM includes this attribute it has not been used in existing measures and a clear use case has not been established. The original purpose for the QDM performer attribute was to designate the individual/organization responsible for reporting the measure results is the same individual/organization that performed the observation or task. However, clinical software generally tracks the individual user entering data and linking that individual to a clinical role, a specialty, or an organization is not easily accomplished. US Quality Core does not include this element in the Key Elements Table for this profile. |

### Communication

QDM defines Communication as the transmission, receipt, or acknowledgement of information sent from a source to a recipient, such as from one clinician to another regarding findings, assessments, plans of care, consultative advice, instructions, educational resources, etc. The following text from the FHIR Communication and Procedure Resources may help to differentiate when to use Communication.

[****FHIR Communication Resource****](http://hl7.org/fhir/communication.html)

This resource is a record of a communication. A communication is a conveyance of information from one entity, a sender, to another entity, a receiver. The sender and receivers may be patients, practitioners, related persons, organizations, or devices. Communication use cases include:

* A reminder or alert delivered to a responsible provider
* A recorded notification from the nurse to the on-call physician (or any other specified person) that a patient's temperature exceeds a value
* A notification to a public health agency of a patient presenting with a communicable disease reportable to the public health agency
* Patient educational material sent by a provider to a patient
* Unable to deliver lab results to ordering physician

Non-patient specific communication use cases may include:

* A nurse call from a hall bathroom
* Advisory for battery service from a pump

**Boundaries and Relationships (Section 8.22.2) - Communication and Encounter**

* The Communication is about the transfer of information (which might or might not occur as part of an encounter), while Encounter is about the coming together (in person or virtually) of a Patient with a Practitioner. Communication does not deal with the duration of a call, it represents the fact that information was transferred at a particular point in time.
* The phone calls involving the Patient should be handled using [Encounter](http://hl7.org/fhir/encounter.html). Phone calls not involving the patient (e.g. between practitioners or practitioner to relative) that are tracked for billing or other purposes can use Communication to represent the information transferred but are not ideal to represent the call itself. A better mechanism for handling such calls will be explored in a future release.

#### Communication, Performed

| | | |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Communication, Performed** | [Communication](StructureDefinition-us-quality-core-communication.md) |   |
|   | [Communication.status](StructureDefinition-us-quality-core-communication-definitions.md#Communication.status) | QDM is a conceptual data model and it does not include a status attribute since it is incorporated in the name of the QDM datatype. US Quality Core requires specific detail about status. Constrain to completed. |
| **QDM Attributes** |   |   |
| code | [Communication.topic](StructureDefinition-us-quality-core-communication-definitions.md#Communication.topic) | Description of the purpose/content with preferred binding to[Communication Topic](http://terminology.hl7.org/ValueSet/communication-topic) |
| id | [Communication.id](StructureDefinition-us-quality-core-communication-definitions.md#Communication.id) |   |
| category | [Communication.category](StructureDefinition-us-quality-core-communication-definitions.md#Communication.category) | QDM includes the attribute category allowing specification of the class of the communication (e.g., alert, notification, reminder, instruction). However, no current measures require this attribute as a specific category has not been significant to measure intent. Therefore, this element is not present in the US Quality Core profile Key Elements Table. |
| medium | [Communication.medium](StructureDefinition-us-quality-core-communication-definitions.md#Communication.medium) | How communication occurs (e.g., physical presence, online written, email, handwritten, etc.). This element is not present in the US Quality Core profile Key Elements Table. |

| authorDatetime | [Communication.extension:recorded](StructureDefinition-us-quality-core-communicationnotdone-definitions.md#Communication.extension:recorded) | Use of this QDM attribute is restricted to the QDM negation rationale use case. It does not apply to a communication with any status other than “not-done”. See Negation Rationale for Communication, Performed. |
| relatedTo | [Communication.basedOn](StructureDefinition-us-quality-core-communication-definitions.md#Communication.basedOn) | An order, proposal or plan fulfilled in whole or in part by this Communication. No current measures require this attribute. Therefore, this element is not present in the US Quality Core profile Key Elements Table |
|   | [Communication.inResponseTo](StructureDefinition-us-quality-core-communication-definitions.md#Communication.inResponseTo) | Response to a communication |

| recipient | [Communication.recipient](StructureDefinition-us-quality-core-communication-definitions.md#Communication.recipient) | Message recipient |
| negationRationale | See Below |   |

##### Negation Rationale for Communication, Performed

Use [US Quality Core Communication Not Done](StructureDefinition-us-quality-core-communicationnotdone.md), which contains:

* [Communication.status](StructureDefinition-us-quality-core-communicationnotdone-definitions.md#Communication.status) - With a value of "not-done" (as implied by the fixed value in the profile)
* [Communication.statusReason](StructureDefinition-us-quality-core-communicationnotdone-definitions.md#Communication.statusReason) - Use value set [NegationReasonCodes](ValueSet-us-quality-core-negation-reason.md)
* [Communication.extension:recorded](StructureDefinition-us-quality-core-communicationnotdone-definitions.md#Communication.extension:recorded) - dateTime when this was made available
* [Communication.topic.extension:notDoneValueSet](StructureDefinition-us-quality-core-communicationnotdone-definitions.md#Communication.topic.extension:notDoneValueSet) - Use [us-quality-core-notDoneValueSet](StructureDefinition-us-quality-core-notDoneValueSet.md) to indicate the specific Communication that was not performed

### Diagnosis

QDM defines Condition/Diagnosis/Problem as a practitioner’s identification of a patient’s disease, illness, injury, or condition. This category contains a single datatype to represent all of these concepts: Diagnosis. A practitioner determines the diagnosis by means of examination, diagnostic test results, patient history, and/or family history.

Based on changes in US Core STU5, US Quality Core now has two methods for expressing conditions, [US Quality Core Condition Problems and Health Concerns Profile](StructureDefinition-us-quality-core-condition-problems-health-concerns.md), and [US Quality Core Condition Encounter Diagnosis Profile](StructureDefinition-us-quality-core-condition-encounter-diagnosis.md). Please reference the respective profile pages for explanation of the rationale for using each of these profiles. Briefly, the Condition Problems and Health Concerns Profile meets the US Core Data for Interoperability (USCDI) version 2 ‘Problems’ and ‘Health Concerns’ and SDOH Problems/Health Concerns requirements. The Condition Encounter Diagnosis Profile further meets the USCDI v2 requirement to define Encounter Diagnosis.

| **Condition - Diagnosis - Problem** | [Condition Problems and Health Concerns](StructureDefinition-us-quality-core-condition-problems-health-concerns.md) |   |
|   | [ConditionProblemsHealthConcerns.clinicalStatus](StructureDefinition-us-quality-core-condition-problems-health-concerns-definitions.md#Condition.clinicalStatus) | QDM is a conceptual data model and it does not include a status attribute since it is incorporated in the name of the QDM datatype. US Quality Core requires specific detail about status. Clinical status defines active, recurrence, relapse, inactive, remission, resolved with required binding to[ConditionClinicalStatusCodes](http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/valueset-condition-clinical.html) |
|   | [ConditionProblemsHealthConcerns.verificationStatus](StructureDefinition-us-quality-core-condition-problems-health-concerns-definitions.md#Condition.verificationStatus) | Verification status defines confirmed, unconfirmed, provisional, differential, refuted, entered-in-error with required binding to[ConditionVerificationStatus](http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/valueset-condition-ver-status.html). QDM does not contain this attribute but it is valuable to determine metadata about a documented condition. |
|   | [ConditionProblemsHealthConcerns.category](StructureDefinition-us-quality-core-condition-problems-health-concerns-definitions.md#Condition.category) | Category defines the class of condition documentation, e.g., problem-list-item, encounter-diagnosis, health-concern. QDM does not contain this attribute but it is valuable to determine metadata about a documented condition. |
| **QDM Attributes** |   |   |
| code | [ConditionProblemsHealthConcerns.code](StructureDefinition-us-quality-core-condition-problems-health-concerns-definitions.md#Condition.code) | Identification of the condition with extensible binding to[US Core Condition Codes.](http://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/ValueSet-us-core-condition-code.html) |

| severity | [ConditionProblemsHealthConcerns.severity](StructureDefinition-us-quality-core-condition-problems-health-concerns-definitions.md#Condition.severity) | Subjective severity of the condition (e.g., severe, moderate, mild). This element has limited feasibility and it is not in the Key Elements Table for US Core or US Quality Core for Condition Diagnosis and Health Concern or Condition Encounter Diagnosis. |
| anatomicalLocationSite | [ConditionProblemsHealthConcerns.bodySite](StructureDefinition-us-quality-core-condition-problems-health-concerns-definitions.md#Condition.bodySite) | Anatomical location, if relevant. This element has limited feasibility and it is not in the Key Elements Table for US Core or US Quality Core for Condition Diagnosis and Health Concern or Condition Encounter Diagnosis. Often, condition.code indicates the body site. |
| recorder | [ConditionProblemsHealthConcerns.recorder](StructureDefinition-us-quality-core-condition-problems-health-concerns-definitions.md#Condition.recorder) | Individual who recorded the record and takes responsibility for its content. This element has limited utility for a measure use case and it is not in the Key Elements Table for US Core or US Quality Core for Condition Diagnosis and Health Concern or Condition Encounter Diagnosis. |
|   | [ConditionProblemsHealthConcerns.asserter](StructureDefinition-us-quality-core-condition-problems-health-concerns-definitions.md#Condition.asserter) | Individual who is making the condition statement. This element has limited utility for a measure use case and it is not in the Key Elements Table for US Core or US Quality Core for Condition Diagnosis and Health Concern or Condition Encounter Diagnosis. |

### Device

QDM defines Device as an instrument, apparatus, implement, machine, contrivance, implant, in-vitro reagent, or other similar or related article, including a component part or accessory, intended for use in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease and not dependent on being metabolized to achieve any of its primary intended purposes.

FHIR defines the [Device Resource](http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/device.html) as a type of a manufactured item that is used in the provision of healthcare without being substantially changed through that activity. The device may be a medical or non-medical device.

FHIR and US Core further differentiate devices into two "classes":

* Devices that interact with the human body but do not stay in it are referred to as non-implantable medical devices.
* Implantable devices are those which stay in the human body with a medical objective for an extended period of time, or even a lifetime.

[Definition reference: Imam W. How to use ISO 13485:2016 to manage implantable devices, **ISO 13485 Blog**. July 4, 2016. Available at: https://advisera.com/13485academy/blog/2017/07/04/how-to-use-iso-134852016-to-manage-implantable-medical-devices/. Accessed 28 January 2020.]

The FHIR [Device Resource](http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/device.html) addresses both implantable and non-implantable devices. US Core only references [Implantable Device](http://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/STU6.1/StructureDefinition-us-core-implantable-device.html). US Quality Core inherits Implantable Device from US Core and builds directly from FHIR for the US Quality Core Device Resource.

#### Device, Applied

QDM originally designed Device, Applied to allow access to documentation of device usage. However, evaluation over time indicates that all documentation about usage of a device occurs as an observation. Thus, information about an implanted pacemaker status check, utilization of a patient-use Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) device, results from a glucometer, or use of a wheelchair or cane should use the QDM datatype, Assessment, Performed, or US Quality Core Observation. Use of Device, Applied has been synonymous with Procedure, Performed, i.e., placement of or adjustment to a device.

"Device Applied" has been retired in QDM 5.6 in favor of using "Procedure, Performed" or "Assessment, Performed" as appropriate.

### Diagnostic Study

QDM defines Diagnostic Study as any kind of medical test performed as a specific test or series of steps to aid in diagnosing or detecting disease (e.g., to establish a diagnosis, measure the progress or recovery from disease, confirm that a person is free from disease). The QDM differentiates diagnostic studies from laboratory tests in that diagnostic studies are those that are not performed in organizations that perform testing on samples of human blood, tissue, or other substances from the body. Diagnostic studies may make use of digital images and textual reports. Such studies include but are not limited to imaging studies, cardiology studies (electrocardiogram, treadmill stress testing), pulmonary-function testing, vascular laboratory testing, and others.

US Quality Core derives from QI-Core, which has added specific constraints on the US Core 6.1.0 profile that address such non-laboratory tests. This US Core v6.1.0 profile addresses (USCDI) requirements for Diagnostic Imaging and Clinical Tests Data Classes including all non-laboratory clinical test results (e.g., radiology and other clinical observations generated from procedures). It includes content represented in the previous US Core v5.0.1 and US Quality Core STU5 version profiles Clinical Test Result, and Imaging Result:

* • [US Quality Core Observation Clinical Result](StructureDefinition-us-quality-core-observation-clinical-result.md) – non-laboratory, non-imaging tests; this profile is sufficiently broad that it should be used instead of the [US Quality Core Simple Observation](StructureDefinition-us-quality-core-simple-observation.md) profile for all non-laboratory test results.

#### Diagnostic Study, Order

“Diagnostic Study, Order” should reference orders for studies that will generate results for activities that meet criteria for Observation Clinical Result.

##### Negation Rationale for Diagnostic Study, Order

Use [US Quality Core Service Not Requested](StructureDefinition-us-quality-core-servicenotrequested.md) and reference the code element specified in the respective observation profile:

#### Diagnostic Study, Performed

Individual studies may use [US Quality Core DiagnosticReport Profile for Report and Note Exchange](StructureDefinition-us-quality-core-diagnosticreport-note.md) to provide information about an individual study (e.g., a cardiac ultrasound, MRI, etc.) although some have considered use of other reporting resources and artifacts. Since new studies regularly become available and the nature of existing studies change over time, a complete list of studies to reference a desired result cannot be assured. Therefore, a quality measure or clinical decision support (CDS) artifacts seeking a specific result value should use [US Quality Core Observation Clinical Result](StructureDefinition-us-quality-core-observation-clinical-result.md) to request a retrieve of the result value desired. This practice will enable implementers to determine which is the best source for the desired observation. LOINC observable entities may indicate specific methods for determination of results. Measure and CDS developers can reference direct reference codes or value sets using such LOINC codes to specify the type of testing considered acceptable to provide sufficient fidelity to their requests.

### Encounter

QDM defines Encounter as an identifiable grouping of healthcare-related activities characterized by the entity relationship between the subject of care and a healthcare provider; such a grouping is determined by the healthcare provider. A patient encounter represents interaction between a healthcare provider and a patient with a face-to-face patient visit to a clinician’s office, or any electronically remote interaction with a clinician for any form of diagnostic treatment or therapeutic event.

#### Encounter Timing

Implementation considerations must be considered when referencing encounter periods (start to end time).  Some clinical sites may leave Encounters "open" until all documentation has been completed which may take 72 hours or more.  However, the actual encounter may have lasted for a much shorter time period (e.g., 15 minutes for an ambulatory encounter). This issue is addressed in The Office of the National Coordinator for Health IT (ONC) Issue Tracking System as item [QDM-235](https://oncprojectracking.healthit.gov/support/projects/QDM/issues/QDM-235?filter=recentlyviewed). Two approaches clinical sites have used to manage this issue include:

* Include a patient check-in and check-out time as part of the visit documentation. These times represent when the patient arrives and leaves, respectively, and these times are used for the Encounter relevant period. However, patient arrival at a location does not necessarily mean the start of the encounter (e.g. a patient arrives an hour earlier than he or she is actually seen by a practitioner).
* Default an Encounter end as 23:59 on the date of the Encounter date if it is left open to allow completion of documentation and update the end time if the practitioner closing the chart enters a specific time that the encounter ended.

Undoubtedly, other clinical sites have implemented other solutions to documenting end times for ambulatory visits. Quality measure and clinical decision support (CDS) artifact authors should consider such issues when testing the validity and reliability of retrieved responses to data queries.

#### Defining Arrival Time

Encounter.period provides the start and stop times of an encounter. Some measures require specific reference to encounter **admissionTime** while others require reference to a concept called **arrivalTime**. The meaning of Encounter.period start cannot reference both timings. Therefore, by convention and based on previous discussions with various HL7 workgroups, Encounter.period **startTime** represents **admissionTime** for hospitalizations. Therefore, to reference **arrivalTime** QDM and US Quality Core use Encounter.location to indicate the physical place where the initial encounter services occur, and Encounter.location.period to indicate the **arrivalTime** and the **departureTime**. Thus, the measure query can differentiate between **admissionTime** used to determine length of stay and **arrivalTime** used to indicate when the patient presented for care at the location which is prior to the formal completion of the admission process.

An example of an encounter can be found [here](Encounter-encounter-ed-example.md)

#### Encounter-Related Diagnoses and Procedures

Versions of QI-Core prior to 6.0.0 have used the [Encounter.diagnosis](StructureDefinition-us-quality-core-encounter-definitions.md#Encounter.diagnosis) element to reference to the list of diagnosis/diagnoses and procedures relevant to the encounter. The [Encounter.diagnosis.usevalue](http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/valueset-diagnosis-role.html) helped to differentiates if the diagnosis or procedure role with respect to the encounter, e.g., the admission diagnosis (AD), the discharge diagnosis (DD), the chief complaint (CC), a comorbidity diagnosis (CM), a pre-op diagnosis (pre-op), a post-op diagnosis (post-op) or a billing diagnosis (billing). In versions prior to QI-Core 6.0.0, QI-Core **principal diagnosis** was specified by Encounter.diagnosis.use= **billing**, and Encounter.diagnosis.rank=1 with similar modeling for principal procedures. In versions prior to QI-Core 6.0.0, QI-Core identified **present on admission (POA)** using Encounter.diagnosis.onAdmission.

Feedback from implementers and standards experts indicated that concepts such as **principal diagnosis**, **principal procedure**, and **present on admission** were more appropriately retrieved using the [Claim profile](StructureDefinition-us-quality-core-claim.md). Medical record coders review documentation and work with physicians to provide the adjudicated determination of what represents a **principal diagnosis**, a **principal procedure**, and the final **present on admission** flag for each diagnosis. Therefore, the [Claim.diagnosis.sequence](StructureDefinition-us-quality-core-claim-definitions.md#Claim.diagnosis.sequence) = 1 plus [Claim.diagnosis.diagnosis[x]](StructureDefinition-us-quality-core-claim-definitions.md#Claim.diagnosis.diagnosis[x]) defines a **principal diagnosis**. The [Claim.diagnosis.onAdmission](StructureDefinition-us-quality-core-claim-definitions.md#Claim.diagnosis.onAdmission) plus [Claim.diagnosis.diagnosis[x]](StructureDefinition-us-quality-core-claim-definitions.md#Claim.diagnosis.diagnosis[x]) defines which diagnoses are **present on admission**. The [Claim.procedure.sequence](StructureDefinition-us-quality-core-claim-definitions.md#Claim.procedure.sequence) = 1 plus [Claim.procedure.procedure[x]](StructureDefinition-us-quality-core-claim-definitions.md#Claim.procedure.procedure[x]) defines a **principal procedure**.

For this reason, QI-Core 6.0.0 no longer includes Encounter.diagnosis in the Key Elements Table of the profile. This also aligns with the US Core 6.1.0 that use [Encounter.reasonCode](StructureDefinition-us-quality-core-encounter-definitions.md#Encounter.reasonCode) and [Encounter.reasonReference](StructureDefinition-us-quality-core-encounter-definitions.md#Encounter.reasonReference) for diagnoses or procedures managed during an encounter. Note the [Encounter.reasonCode](StructureDefinition-us-quality-core-encounter-definitions.md#Encounter.reasonCode) preferred binding to [Encounter Reason Code value set](http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/valueset-encounter-reason.html) allows use of SNOMED-CT clinical findings, procedures, context-dependent categories, and events; [Encounter.reasonReference](StructureDefinition-us-quality-core-encounter-definitions.md#Encounter.reasonReference) allows reference to [US Quality Core ConditionProblemsHeatlhConcerns](StructureDefinition-us-quality-core-condition-problems-health-concerns.md), [US Quality Core ConditionEncounterDiagnosis](StructureDefinition-us-quality-core-condition-encounter-diagnosis.md), [US Quality Core Procedure](StructureDefinition-us-quality-core-procedure.md), [US Quality Core SimpleObservation](StructureDefinition-us-quality-core-simple-observation.md), and [US Quality Core ImmunzationRecommendation](StructureDefinition-us-quality-core-immunizationrecommendation.md).

##### Negation Rationale for Encounter, Order

Use [US Quality Core Service Not Requested](StructureDefinition-us-quality-core-servicenotrequested.md), which contains:

* [ServiceRequest.doNotPerform](StructureDefinition-us-quality-core-servicenotrequested-definitions.md#ServiceRequest.doNotPerform) - With a value of "true" (as implied by the fixed value in the profile)
* [ServiceRequest.status](StructureDefinition-us-quality-core-servicenotrequested-definitions.md#ServiceRequest.status) - With a value of "completed"
* [ServiceRequest.extension:reasonRefused](StructureDefinition-us-quality-core-servicenotrequested-definitions.md#ServiceRequest.extension:reasonRefused) - Use value set [NegationReasonCodes](ValueSet-us-quality-core-negation-reason.md)
* [ServiceRequest.authoredOn](StructureDefinition-us-quality-core-servicenotrequested-definitions.md#ServiceRequest.authoredOn) - dateTime when this was made available
* [ServiceRequest.code.extension:notDoneValueSet](StructureDefinition-us-quality-core-servicenotrequested-definitions.md#ServiceRequest.code.extension:notDoneValueSet) - Use [us-quality-core-notDoneValueSet](StructureDefinition-us-quality-core-notDoneValueSet.md) to indicate the specific ServiceRequest that was not performed

|   | [Encounter.status](StructureDefinition-us-quality-core-encounter-definitions.md#Encounter.status) | Constrain to - arrived, triaged, in-progress, on-leave, finished Note: most retrospective eCQMs will constrain Encounter.status to “finished”. Measures designed to monitor active encounters should consider using “in-progress”. While QDM does not have an attribute comparable to status, as a conceptual model, status is implied by the name “Encounter, Performed”. |
| **QDM Attribute** |   |   |

| relatedTo | [Encounter.basedOn](StructureDefinition-us-quality-core-encounter-definitions.md#Encounter.basedOn) | Prior versions of US Quality Core included a Must Support for basedOn to reference the ServiceRequest generating the encounter. However, there has been no use of this element. Therefore, it no longer appears in the Encounter profile Key Element Table. |

| lengthOfStay | [Encounter.length](StructureDefinition-us-quality-core-encounter-definitions.md#Encounter.length) | The QDM concept length of stay is expressed using CQL expressions rather than a specific Encounter profile element. Therefore, this element is no longer included in the Encounter profile Key Element Table. |

| admissionSource | [Encounter.hospitalization.admitSource](StructureDefinition-us-quality-core-encounter-definitions.md#Encounter.hospitalization.admitSource) | The QDM concept hospital admission source has not been used in CMS measures to-date. In an effort to streamline US Quality Core v0.5.0, this element is no longer included in the Encounter profile Key Element Table. It is available from the Snapshot Table but it is not clear that the information is available in clinical records even though it may be in administrative records. |
| dischargeDisposition | [Encounter.hospitalization.dischargeDisposition](StructureDefinition-us-quality-core-encounter-definitions.md#Encounter.hospitalization.dischargeDisposition) | Category or kind of location to which the patient is discharged. E.g., home, hospice, long-term care, etc. |

| locationPeriod | [Encounter.location.period](StructureDefinition-us-quality-core-encounter-definitions.md#Encounter.location.period) | The time during which the patient is present at a specific location. Measures use the location period to identify the arrival and departure times for a location, distinguishing those times from the Encounter.period which provides a hospital**admissionTime**and**dischargeTime**. |
| participant | [Encounter.participant.individual](StructureDefinition-us-quality-core-encounter-definitions.md#Encounter.participant.individual) | QDM includes this attribute to designate the individual responsible the patient’s care during this encounter. However, any given encounter may have more than one participant so using this element to specify attribution of care is challenging. Further clinical software generally tracks the individual user entering data and linking that individual to a clinical role, a specialty, or an organization is not easily accomplished. Therefore, US Quality Core STU 6 has removed this element from the Key Elements Table. It is not used in measures to-date. |
|   | [Encounter.serviceProvider](StructureDefinition-us-quality-core-encounter-definitions.md#Encounter.serviceProvider) | Encounter.serviceProvider identifies the organization that is primarily responsible for the Encounter’s services. Since US Core Encounter includes serviceProvider as a USCDI element, US Quality Core STU 6 includes Encounter.serviceProvider in the Key Elements Table. Unlike details about a participant, the organization responsible for the encounter should be available. |

##### Negation Rationale for Encounter, Recommended

Use [US Quality Core Service Not Requested](StructureDefinition-us-quality-core-servicenotrequested.md), which contains:

* [ServiceRequest.doNotPerform](StructureDefinition-us-quality-core-servicenotrequested-definitions.md#ServiceRequest.doNotPerform) - With a value of "true" (as implied by the fixed value in the profile)
* [ServiceRequest.status](StructureDefinition-us-quality-core-servicenotrequested-definitions.md#ServiceRequest.status) - With a value of "completed"
* [ServiceRequest.extension:reasonRefused](StructureDefinition-us-quality-core-servicenotrequested-definitions.md#ServiceRequest.extension:reasonRefused) - Use value set [NegationReasonCodes](ValueSet-us-quality-core-negation-reason.md)

### Family History

QDM defines Family History as a diagnosis or problem experienced by a family member of the patient. Typically, a family history will not contain very much detail, but the simple identification of a diagnosis or problem in the patient’s family history may be relevant to the care of the patient.

### Immunization

QDM defines Immunization as vaccines administered to patients in healthcare settings but does not include non-vaccine agents. The [FHIR Immunization Recommendation](http://hl7.org/fhir/immunizationrecommendation.html) resource is specifically designed to provide an immunization forecast from a forecasting engine to a provider, basically to carry clinical decision support recommendations specific to immunizations and, therefore, is not consistent with the intent of the QDM datatype "Immunization, Order" or "Immunization, Administered." The FHIR [Immunization Evaluation](http://hl7.org/fhir/immunizationevaluation.html) references an appraisal of an immunization that was administered to determine if it is valid with respect to the expected immunization schedule. The [US Core Immunization](http://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/STU6.1/StructureDefinition-us-core-immunization.html) profile is most consistent with the QDM datatype **Immunization, Administered**. The mapping tables provided include mapping from QDM **Immunization, Administered** and a reference to the FHIR [Immunization Evaluation](http://hl7.org/fhir/immunizationevaluation.html) resource. Note, the mapping table includes additional metadata about immunizations that QDM does not address, but that may be relevant to quality measures or clinical decision support (CDS) artifacts.

| reason | [Immunization.reasonCode](StructureDefinition-us-quality-core-immunization-definitions.md#Immunization.reasonCode) | Why the immunization occurred. In most measure use cases, immunization rationale is not required. Therefore, this element is not present in the US Quality Core profile Key Elements Table. |

| authorDatetime | [Immunization.recorded](StructureDefinition-us-quality-core-immunization-definitions.md#Immunization.recorded) | When the immunization was first captured in the subject's record. This QDM attribute is most useful for the negation rationale use case – i.e., documentation why an immunization did not happen. Since the meaning is the timing of information capture, this element may also not be helpful to determine when vaccines given elsewhere were administered. |
| performer | [Immunization.performer.actor](StructureDefinition-us-quality-core-immunization-definitions.md#Immunization.performer) | Although QDM includes this attribute it has not been used in existing measures and a clear use case has not been established.

However, clinical software generally tracks the individual user entering data and linking that individual to a clinical role, a specialty, or an organization is not easily accomplished. |

##### Negation Rationale for Immunization, Administered

Use [US Quality Core ImmunizationNotDone](StructureDefinition-us-quality-core-immunizationnotdone.md), which contains:

#### Immunization, Order

This QDM context references the US Quality Core MedicationRequest profile as there is no other FHIR resource to reference an order for an immunization. The mapping uses the US Quality Core MedicationRequest resource with the MedicationRequest.intent = **order** and MedicationRequest.setting set to the setting most appropriate for the intended meaning of the quality measure or clinical decision support (CDS) expression.

### Individual Characteristics

QDM’s approach to defining information about participants in the healthcare process by defining specific attributes of healthcare participants. These properties of a patient, clinician, provider, or facility include demographics, behavioral factors, social or cultural factors, available resources, and preferences. Behaviors reference responses or actions that affect (either positively or negatively) health or healthcare. Included in this category are mental health issues, adherence issues unrelated to other factors or resources, coping ability, grief issues, and substance use/abuse. Social/cultural factors are characteristics of an individual related to family/caregiver support, education, and literacy (including health literacy), primary language, cultural beliefs (including health beliefs), persistent life stressors, spiritual and religious beliefs, immigration status, and history of abuse or neglect. Resources are means available to a patient to meet health and healthcare needs, which might include caregiver support, insurance coverage, financial resources, and community resources to which the patient is already connected and from which the patient is receiving benefit. Preferences are choices made by patients and their caregivers relative to options for care or treatment (including scheduling, care experience, and meeting of personal health goals) and the sharing and disclosure of their health information.

FHIR more effectively represents these concepts in the Level 3 Administration Module – base data that is linked into other modules for clinical content, finance/billing, workflow, etc. The Administration Module specifies information about the patient, related person, practitioner and organization that is the basis of healthcare-related interactions such as encounters. QDM version 5.5 adopted a similar approach to such information by adding a new concept called **Entities. Entities** represent concepts that can be used to specify details about an actor (or performer) participant in any activity represented by a QDM datatype. These **entities** are analogous to the FHIR resources **Patient, RelatedPerson, Practitioner,** and **Organization,** respectively called **Patient, CarePartner, Practitioner** and **Organization** in QDM. The mapping tables show these direct relationships to FHIR resources. However, to maintain backward compatibility with prior QDM versions, QDM 5.5 retains the concept of Patient Characteristics for some metadata about a patient; most of these characteristics map directly to metadata elements in the FHIR Patient resource. QDM 5.5 removed the Provider Characteristics QDM **datatype** in favor of the Practitioner and Organization entities since there had been little, if any, use of these QDM elements.

Accommodating patient-related metadata requires US Quality Core extensions for several elements including:

* Clinical Trial – Patients may be excluded from some quality measures or clinical decision support (CDS) workflows if they are participating in clinical trials. It is often necessary to determine the nature of the trial as exclusions may only apply if the clinical trial addresses the same clinical condition as the measure or CDS artifact, or if treatments potentially used in the clinical trial or the measure or CDS intervention conflict.

QDM 5.5 also added a new QDM **datatype Related Person** to allow reference to an individual who has a personal or non-healthcare-specific professional relationship with a patient. Modeled the same as the **CarePartner** entity, the **Related Person** is an individual from whose record clinical information should be retrieved to support care provided to the index patient. 

* Example 1: An infant’s gestational age at the time of birth may be calculated as the difference between the days between the mother’s estimated date of delivery (EDD) and the actual birth date. The mother’s EDD might be entered directly on the infant’s record as an observable entity about a **Related Person** (the infant’s mother). Alternatively, a cross-context query might request the information from the **Related Person’s** (mother’s) record.
* Example 2: An organ recipient risk factor may include a donor’s positive Hepatitis C antibody result. The result relates to the donor (Related Person) whether that result is present on the recipient’s record or if the a cross-context query to the donor’s record retrieves the information.

### Intervention

QDM defines Intervention as a course of action intended to achieve a result in the care of persons with health problems that does not involve direct physical contact with a patient. Examples include patient education and therapeutic communication.

#### Procedure Vs Intervention

FHIR references both of these concepts using the **Procedure** resource, specifically noting a process that involves verification of the patient's comprehension or to change the patient's mental state would be a Procedure. Therefore, both QDM **datatypes**, Procedure and Intervention are included in this section of the QDM to US Quality Core mapping especially since all of the QDM attributes for each of these QDM **datatypes** are identical.

#### Intervention, Performed

| | | |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Intervention, Performed** | [Procedure](StructureDefinition-us-quality-core-procedure.md) |   |
| **QDM Attributes** |   |   |
| status | [Procedure.status](StructureDefinition-us-quality-core-procedure-definitions.md#Procedure.status) | While QDM does not have an attribute comparable to status, as a conceptual model, status is implied by the QDM datatype name “Procedure, Performed”. Constrain to “completed” |
| code | [Procedure.code](StructureDefinition-us-quality-core-procedure-definitions.md#Procedure.code) | Identification of the procedure. Extensible binding to[US Core Procedure Codes](http://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/STU6.1/ValueSet-us-core-procedure-code.html) |
| id | [Procedure.id](StructureDefinition-us-quality-core-procedure-definitions.md#Procedure.id) |   |
| relatedTo | [Procedure.basedOn](StructureDefinition-us-quality-core-procedure-definitions.md#Procedure.basedOn) | A reference to a resource that contains details of the request for this procedure. There has not been a use case for this element in existing measures; therefore, it is not included in the US Quality Core profile Key Elements Table. |
| method | N/A | Procedure.method does not exist in FHIR. Rather than create an extension, US Quality Core's approach is to assume the Procedure.code includes reference to the method. |
| rank | [Claim.procedure.sequence](StructureDefinition-us-quality-core-claim-definitions.md#Claim.procedure.sequence) | Used to identify a principal procedure in the content of an encounter. See discussion in the QDM “Encounter, Performed” section indicating the rationale for using the Claim profile to identify principal or primary procedures and conditions. |
| priority | N/A | This QDM attribute is intended to reference elective from non-elective procedures. See discussion regarding “Encounter, Order”**priority**which was created to differentiate elective encounters from non-elective encounters. Similar to the encounter discussion, a given procedure is not inherently elective or non-elective, the urgency is based on a patient’s status and other factors. Information about urgency, elective, non-elective may be found a scheduling or appointment application which may generate a tag for a procedure in the clinical record. This item is not present in the FHIR Procedure resource. Measure developers should work with clinical sites to determine the most effective method for identifying procedure priority. |
| anatomicalLocationSite | [Procedure.bodySite](StructureDefinition-us-quality-core-procedure-definitions.md#Procedure.bodySite) | Target body sites with preferred binding to[SNOMEDCT Body Structures](http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/valueset-body-site.html). Existing measures have not provided a use case for this element. Therefore, the element does not appear in the US Quality Core profile Key Elements Table. |
| reason | [Procedure.reasonCode](StructureDefinition-us-quality-core-procedure-definitions.md#Procedure.reasonCode) | Code reason procedure is performed. Preferred binding to[Procedure Reason Codes](http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/valueset-procedure-reason.html). |
| result | [Simple Observation](StructureDefinition-us-quality-core-simple-observation.md)or[Observation Clinical Result](StructureDefinition-us-quality-core-observation-clinical-result.md)that includes the element[SimpleObservation.partOf](StructureDefinition-us-quality-core-simple-observation-definitions.md#Observation.partOf)to reference the procedure to which it applies. | [Procedure.report](StructureDefinition-us-quality-core-procedure-definitions.md#Procedure.report)references[DiagnosticReport-note](StructureDefinition-us-quality-core-diagnosticreport-note.md), DocumentReference, Composition (histology result, pathology report, surgical report, etc.); the latter two are not US Quality Core resources. However, based on feedback suggested that a procedure result might be better identified as[Simple Observation](StructureDefinition-us-quality-core-simple-observation.md)or[Observation Clinical Result](StructureDefinition-us-quality-core-observation-clinical-result.md)that includes the element[SimpleObservation.partOf](StructureDefinition-us-quality-core-simple-observation-definitions.md#Observation.partOf)resources referencing the[ObservatonClinicalResult.partOf](StructureDefinition-us-quality-core-observation-clinical-result-definitions.md#Observation.partOf), or the[SimpleObservation.partOf](StructureDefinition-us-quality-core-simple-observation-definitions.md#Observation.partOf)element to reference the procedure to which it applies. |
| negationRationale | See Below |   |
| relevantDatetime | [Procedure.performed[x] dateTime](StructureDefinition-us-quality-core-procedure-definitions.md#Procedure.performed[x]) | When the procedure was performed (as a single point in time). |
| relevantPeriod | [Procedure.performed[x] Period](StructureDefinition-us-quality-core-procedure-definitions.md#Procedure.performed[x]) | When the procedure was performed (over a period of time). |
| incisionDatetime | [Procedure.extension:incisionDateTime](StructureDefinition-us-quality-core-procedure-definitions.md#Procedure.extension) | The first incision time. Existing measures do not use this element; therefore, it is not included in the US Quality Core profile Key Elements Table. |
| authorDatetime | [Procedure.extension:recorded](StructureDefinition-us-quality-core-procedure-definitions.md#Procedure.extension:recorded) | When the procedure was first captured in the subject’s record. This element is useful for historical procedures and for the QDM negation rationale concept. |
|   | [Procedure.usedReference](StructureDefinition-us-quality-core-procedurenotdone-definitions.md#Procedure.usedReference)[Procedure.usedCode](StructureDefinition-us-quality-core-procedure-definitions.md#Procedure.usedCode) | These elements help to add reference to a device, medication, or substance used as part of a procedure the US Quality Core element to address the device is used by the procedure. However, feedback has suggested that implementers prefer a direct, precoordinated code for the procedure that also indicates the type of device used rather than having to connect a specific item/device used to perform the procedure. Thus, while modeling allows usedCode or usedReference, feasibility is very limited. For that reason, these elements are not included in the US Quality Core profile Key Elements Table. |
| components | N/A | Procedure does not include component. |
| component.code | N/A | N/A |
| component.result | N/A | N/A |
| performer | [Procedure.performer.actor](StructureDefinition-us-quality-core-procedure-definitions.md#Procedure.performer.actor) | Although QDM includes this attribute it has not been used in existing measures and a clear use case has not been established. The original purpose for the QDM**requester**attribute was to designate the individual/organization responsible for reporting the measure results is the same individual/organization that requested the procedure or service. However, clinical software generally tracks the individual user entering data and linking that individual to a clinical role, a specialty, or an organization is not easily accomplished |

##### Negation Rationale for Intervention, Performed

##### Negation Rationale for Intervention, Recommended

Use [US Quality Core Service Not Requested](StructureDefinition-us-quality-core-servicenotrequested.md) and reference the code element specified in the respective observation profile:

* [ServiceRequest.doNotPerform](StructureDefinition-us-quality-core-servicenotrequested-definitions.md#ServiceRequest.doNotPerform) - With a value of "true" (as implied by the fixed value in the profile)

### Laboratory Test

QDM defines Laboratory Test as a medical procedure that involves testing a sample of blood, urine, or other body fluids or specimens. Tests can help determine a diagnosis, plan treatment, check to see if treatment is working, or monitor the disease over time. This QDM data category for Laboratory Test is only used for information about the subject of record.

Rather than directly referencing the [US Core Laboratory Result Observation Profile](http://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/STU6.1/StructureDefinition-us-core-observation-lab.html), QI-Core 5.0.0 builds on that profile to add further constraint requirements and US Quality Core inherits that as [US Quality Core Laboratory Result Observation](StructureDefinition-us-quality-core-observation-lab.md). The reason for this approach is to assure the profile Key Elements Table includes elements such as interpretation, specific result datatypes, and additional constraints.

Each laboratory test may be ordered individually or in a panel. Many use panels for convenience for ordering laboratory tests. Since new laboratory panels regularly become available and the myriad of potential laboratory panels available, a complete list cannot be assured. LOINC observable entities may indicate specific methods for determination of results. Measure and CDS developers can reference direct reference codes or value sets using such LOINC codes to specify the type of testing considered acceptable to provide sufficient fidelity to their requests.

#### Laboratory Test, Order

“Laboratory Test, Order” should reference orders for studies that will generate results for activities that meet criteria for Observation Lab Result.

### Medication

QDM defines Medication as clinical drugs or chemical substances intended for use in the medical diagnosis, cure, treatment, or prevention of disease. Medications are defined as direct referenced values or value sets containing values derived from code systems such as RxNorm. QDM defines five contexts for Medication, each of which is listed below referencing the US Core or FHIR resource which provides the expected context:

#### Medication, Active

This QDM context correlates with a medication on a patient’s active medication list. In QI-Core STU3, Medication, Active was mapped to MedicationStatement. However, consistent with US Core STU4 and subsequent versions, medication list should use MedicationRequest and not MedicationStatement. The mapping table provides guidance about how to use MedicationRequest.requester to specify medications ordered directly, those reported by a physician and those reported by the patient for a medication list.

Include all MedicationRequest resources with an intent = "order" representing authorized medication orders directly derived from the system’s orders.

The MedicationRequest **SHALL** include all practitioner-reported and "self-reported" medications reported by the Provider, Patient or Related Person.

* **SHALL** use reported[x] to indicate the MedicationRequest record was captured as a secondary “reported” record rather than an original primary source-of-truth record. It may also indicate the source of the report
* When recording "self-reported" or "self-prescribed" medications **SHALL** use intent = “plan”
* When recording "self-prescribed" orders, **SHOULD** use the requester to indicate the Patient or RelatedPerson as the prescriber

However, clinical software generally tracks the individual user entering data and linking that individual to a clinical role, a specialty, or an organization is not easily accomplished. |

#### Medication, Administered

This QDM context correlates with a record of a patient consuming or otherwise being administered a medication. It references individual medication administration events and, therefore, may not reference frequency of administration. Note that a separate QDM and US Core profile address Immunization, Administered.

However, clinical software generally tracks the individual user entering data and linking that individual to a clinical role, a specialty, or an organization is not easily accomplished. |

##### Negation Rationale for Medication, Administered

Use [US Quality Core MedicationAdministrationNotDone](StructureDefinition-us-quality-core-medicationadministrationnotdone.md), which contains:

* [MedicationAdministration.status](StructureDefinition-us-quality-core-medicationadministrationnotdone-definitions.md#MedicationAdministration.status) - With a value of "not-done" (as implied by the fixed value in the profile)
* [MedicationAdministration.statusReason](StructureDefinition-us-quality-core-medicationadministrationnotdone-definitions.md#MedicationAdministration.statusReason) - Use value set [NegationReasonCodes](ValueSet-us-quality-core-negation-reason.md)

* [MedicationAdministration.medication[x].extension:notDoneValueSet](StructureDefinition-us-quality-core-medicationadministrationnotdone-definitions.md#MedicationAdministration.medication[x].extension:notDoneValueSet) - Use [us-quality-core-notDoneValueSet](StructureDefinition-us-quality-core-notDoneValueSet.md) to indicate the specific MedicationAdministration that was not performed

#### Medication, Discharge

This QDM context specifically references the discharge medication list provided to a patient at the time of discharge from an inpatient setting. The list may include reference to new prescriptions sent to a pharmacy for dispensing and self-administration after discharge. It may also include over-the-counter medications and those medications already present in the patient’s home for which new prescriptions are not necessary. The QDM Medication, Discharge concept is mapped to MedicationRequest as a request to the patient to take the medication with MedicationRequest.intent = **plan** and MedicationRequest.setting = **discharge.**

MedicationRequest.intent should always be **order** even if the medication is patient reported and the order is not processed as an e-prescription. The reporter is specified as MedicationRequest.reported[x] which is a reportedBoolean and uses reportedReference (patient, practitioner, practitionerRole, relatedPerson, organization).

This change should also be used to reference the mapping from QDM Medication, Order which can address order or recommended.

The time the medication was handed over to the patient or representative may not be populated.) Note that medications not picked up are restocked such that a MedicationDispense.status = completed will assure the patient or representative received the medication even if whenHandedOver is not available. Therefore, measure developers should consider including the time whenPrepared if whenHandedOver is null and status = completed. |

However, clinical software generally tracks the individual user entering data and linking that individual to a clinical role, a specialty, or an organization is not easily accomplished. |

##### Negation Rationale for Medication, Dispensed

Use [US Quality Core MedicationDispenseDeclined](StructureDefinition-us-quality-core-medicationdispensedeclined.md), which contains:

* [MedicationDispense.status](StructureDefinition-us-quality-core-medicationdispensedeclined-definitions.md#MedicationDispense.status) - With a value of "declined" (as implied by the fixed value in the profile)
* [MedicationDispense.statusReason[x]](StructureDefinition-us-quality-core-medicationdispensedeclined-definitions.md#MedicationDispense.statusReason[x]) - Use value set [NegationReasonCodes](ValueSet-us-quality-core-negation-reason.md)
* [MedicationDispense.extension:recorded](StructureDefinition-us-quality-core-medicationdispensedeclined-definitions.md#MedicationDispense.extension:recorded) - dateTime when this was made available
* [MedicationDispense.medication[x].extension:notDoneValueSet](StructureDefinition-us-quality-core-medicationdispensedeclined-definitions.md#MedicationDispense.medication[x].extension:notDoneValueSet) - Use [us-quality-core-notDoneValueSet](StructureDefinition-us-quality-core-notDoneValueSet.md) to indicate the specific MedicationDispense that was not performed

The MedicationDispensed.status is fixed to "declined" which is defined as "The dispense was declined and not performed." Considering the clinical workflow, only the pharmacist likely performs the "decline" status - based on medication interaction or on failure of insurance authorization (e.g., medication interaction, denial of insurance authorization, treatment abandonment due to co-pay cost). But the patient would not enter the status, only the pharmacist would do so. The use case likely still works for the measure developer intent (that a valid reason exists for not dispensing the medication). However, if the measure developer wants to address patient's decisions to avoid dispensing, the patient will likely not show up at the pharmacy for the medication to be dispensed - hence, there will be no dispensing event. The best way to capture that scenario may be to assure the MedicationRequest includes a Patient reason.

#### Medication, Order

This QDM context references the US Quality Core MedicationRequest profile with MedicationRequest.intent = **order** and MedicationRequest.setting as the most appropriate for the intended meaning of the quality measure or clinical decision support (CDS) expression.

### Participation

QDM defines Participation as a patient’s coverage by a program such as an insurance or medical plan or a payment agreement. Such programs can include patient-centered medical home, disease-specific programs, etc. Definitions modeled similar to the FHIR R4 [Coverage](http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/coverage.html) resource.

### Physical Exam

QDM defines Physical Exam as the evaluation of the patient’s body and/or mental status exam to determine its state of health. The techniques of examination can include palpation (feeling with the hands or fingers), percussion (tapping with the fingers), auscultation (listening), visual inspection or observation, inquisition and smell. Measurements may include vital signs (blood pressure, pulse, respiration) as well as other clinical measures (such as expiratory flow rate and size of lesion). Physical exam includes psychiatric examinations.

US Core STU6 added twelve observation profiles that address specific elements of physical examinations. The following table lists each profile and the respective data element codes referenced in each of those profiles.

#### Physical Exam, Order

QDM “Physical Exam, Order” should use ServiceRequest with **intent** = order for the specific examination requested.

However, clinical software generally tracks the individual user entering data and linking that individual to a clinical role, a specialty, or an organization is not easily accomplished. |

##### Negation Rationale for Physical Exam, Order

Use [US Quality Core Service Not Requested](StructureDefinition-us-quality-core-servicenotrequested.md) and reference the code element specified in the respective observation profile:

* [ServiceRequest.doNotPerform](StructureDefinition-us-quality-core-servicenotrequested-definitions.md#ServiceRequest.doNotPerform) - With a value of "true" (as implied by the fixed value in the profile)
* [ServiceRequest.status](StructureDefinition-us-quality-core-servicenotrequested-definitions.md#ServiceRequest.status) - With a value of "completed"
* [ServiceRequest.extension:reasonRefused](StructureDefinition-us-quality-core-servicenotrequested-definitions.md#ServiceRequest.extension:reasonRefused) - Use value set [NegationReasonCodes](ValueSet-us-quality-core-negation-reason.md)

#### Physical Exam, Performed

QDM “Physical Exam, Performed” should reference the specific US Core vital signs profiles directly as appropriate. Some results may also be identified using the US Quality Core Observation Clinical Result profile. The US Quality Core Simple Observation profile may be appropriate for other physical examination observations not covered by the Observation Clinical Result profile.

While QDM does not have an attribute comparable to status, as a conceptual model, status is implied by the name “Physical Exam, Performed” datatype. |
|   | [Observation.category](StructureDefinition-us-quality-core-simple-observation-definitions.md#Observation.category) | Category helps to narrow the request to the class of observation required to meet measure intent. Each US Quality Core or US Core profile has a specific binding to concepts appropriate to the respective profile.

##### Negation Rationale for Physical Exam, Performed

Use [US Quality Core Observation Cancelled](StructureDefinition-us-quality-core-observationcancelled.md) and reference the code element specified in the respective observation profile:

* [Observation.status](StructureDefinition-us-quality-core-observationcancelled-definitions.md#Observation.status) - With a value of "cancelled" (as implied by the fixed value in the profile)

* [Observation.code.extension:notDoneValueSet](StructureDefinition-us-quality-core-observationcancelled-definitions.md#Observation.code.extension:notDoneValueSet) - Use [us-quality-core-notDoneValueSet](StructureDefinition-us-quality-core-notDoneValueSet.md) to indicate the specific Observation that was not performed

#### Physical Exam, Recommended

QDM “Physical Exam, Recommended” should use ServiceRequest with **intent** = plan for the specific examination recommended.

##### Negation Rationale for Physical Exam, Recommended

Use [US Quality Core Service Not Requested](StructureDefinition-us-quality-core-servicenotrequested.md) and reference the code element specified in the respective observation profile:

* [ServiceRequest.doNotPerform](StructureDefinition-us-quality-core-servicenotrequested-definitions.md#ServiceRequest.doNotPerform) - With a value of "true" (as implied by the fixed value in the profile)
* [ServiceRequest.status](StructureDefinition-us-quality-core-servicenotrequested-definitions.md#ServiceRequest.status) - With a value of "completed"
* [ServiceRequest.extension:reasonRefused](StructureDefinition-us-quality-core-servicenotrequested-definitions.md#ServiceRequest.extension:reasonRefused) - Use value set [NegationReasonCodes](ValueSet-us-quality-core-negation-reason.md)
* [ServiceRequest.authoredOn](StructureDefinition-us-quality-core-servicenotrequested-definitions.md#ServiceRequest.authoredOn) - dateTime when this was made available
* [ServiceRequest.code.extension:notDoneValueSet](StructureDefinition-us-quality-core-servicenotrequested-definitions.md#ServiceRequest.code.extension:notDoneValueSet) - Use [us-quality-core-notDoneValueSet](StructureDefinition-us-quality-core-notDoneValueSet.md) to indicate the specific ServiceRequest that was not performed

### Procedure

QDM defines Procedure as an act whose immediate and primary outcome (post-condition) is the alteration of the physical condition of the subject. A **procedure** may be a surgery or other type of physical manipulation of a person’s body in whole or in part for purposes of making observations and diagnoses or providing treatment.

#### Procedure Vs Intervention

FHIR references both of these concepts using the Procedure resource, specifically noting a process that involves verification of the patient’s comprehension or to change the patient’s mental state would be a Procedure.

#### Procedure Vs Task

Some use cases have considered differentiating a FHIR Procedure Resource from a FHIR core Task Resource. For example, should a request to perform medication reconciliation be classified as a Task or a Procedure? The FHIR [Procedure Resource](http://hl7.org/fhir/procedure.html) Boundaries and Relationships (Section 9.3.2) provides some distinction between a [Task](http://hl7.org/fhir/task.html) and a [Procedure](http://hl7.org/fhir/procedure.html):

**A [Task](http://hl7.org/fhir/task.html) is a workflow step such as cancelling an order, fulfilling an order, signing an order, merging a set of records, admitting a patient. Procedures are actions that are intended to result in a physical or mental change to or for the subject (e.g. surgery, physiotherapy, training, counseling). A [Task](http://hl7.org/fhir/task.html) resource often exists in parallel with clinical resources. For example, a [Task](http://hl7.org/fhir/task.html) might request fulfillment of a [ServiceRequest](http://hl7.org/fhir/servicerequest.html) ordering a Procedure.**

Based on the guidance provided above, the workflow step to reconcile medication lists may be considered a Task to perform the Procedure that includes reviewing the medication list with the patient to assure it is correct and to education the patient about proper medication usage.

The sponsoring work group is specifically seeking feedback on the following suggestions for use of Task rather than Procedure for workflow steps that require attestation such as medication list review or reconciliation: Example: A workflow step to review or to reconcile medication lists may be considered a Task to perform the Procedure that includes reviewing the medication list with the patient to assure it is correct and to educate the patient about proper medication usage. Thus, a Task can reference the Task.focus as a procedure.

QDM 5.6 does not address Task; therefore, there is no direct mapping from QDM Intervention or Procedure to the FHIR Task resource. The mapping presented is from QDM to US Quality Core referencing the FHIR Procedure resource.

Consistent with the method for specifying QDM’s concept negation rationale, a [TaskRejected](StructureDefinition-us-quality-core-taskrejected.md) is represented with the following content:

* [Task.status](StructureDefinition-us-quality-core-taskrejected-definitions.md#Task.status) with valueset-task-status constrained to "rejected" (The potential performer who claimed ownership of the task has decided not to execute it prior to performing any action.)
* [Task.statusReason](StructureDefinition-us-quality-core-taskrejected-definitions.md#Task.statusReason) binding to Negation Reason Codes (extensible)
* [Task.code](StructureDefinition-us-quality-core-taskrejected-definitions.md#Task.code) (Codes to identify how the task manages fulfillment of activities - the specific choice depends on the measure context) the direct reference code, it needs a cardinality of 1..1 and binding to the code or value set (it would need a notDoneValueSet url: [notDoneValueSet](StructureDefinition-us-quality-core-notDoneValueSet.md) to reference the value set not performed)
* [Task.focus](StructureDefinition-us-quality-core-taskrejected-definitions.md#Task.focus) to reference the Resource (likely procedure) the task was acting on
* [Task.encounter](StructureDefinition-us-quality-core-taskrejected-definitions.md#Task.encounter) (Healthcare event during which this task originated)
* [Task.for](StructureDefinition-us-quality-core-taskrejected-definitions.md#Task.for) (Beneficiary of the Task) Reference (us-quality-core-patient)
* [Task.executionPeriod](StructureDefinition-us-quality-core-taskrejected-definitions.md#Task.executionPeriod) for the period/dateTime - the timing the task was rejected and the reason.

#### Procedure Priority

Procedure: **priority** has the following definition:

**Priority indicates the urgency of the procedure or the encounter referenced. In [electronic clinical quality measures] (eCQMs) the priority attribute will help specify elective from urgent encounters (e.g., hospital admissions) or procedures. Priority is a codeable concept (i.e., may use a direct reference code or a value set). For example, priority is used to express an elective procedure or encounter from an emergency procedure or encounter.**

As noted in the QDM to US Quality Core Mapping for Encounter-Related Diagnoses and Procedures, a specific measure may have interest in evaluating care provided for elective procedures (e.g., hip surgery due to osteoarthritis) while excluding emergency, non-planned procedures (e.g., hip surgery due to acute fracture). The procedure code does not necessarily allow differentiation of the two concepts. A [ServiceRequest.priority](StructureDefinition-us-quality-core-servicerequest-definitions.md#ServiceRequest.priority) does have the ability to differentiate the urgency with which the **request** (or order) should be fulfilled. However, there is no current usage in existing measures and the ServiceRequest.priority element is not included in the ServiceRequest Key Element Table. There is no element within the FHIR Procedure resource to address the issue. Based on lack of a current use case US Quality Core has not added an extension to address Procedure.priority and, as a result, there is no direct mapping from the QDM Procedure priority attribute to US Quality Core.

#### Procedure, Performed

| | | |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Procedure, Performed** | [Procedure](StructureDefinition-us-quality-core-procedure.md) |   |
| **QDM Attributes** |   |   |
| status | [Procedure.status](StructureDefinition-us-quality-core-procedure-definitions.md#Procedure.status) | While QDM does not have an attribute comparable to status, as a conceptual model,**status**is implied by the QDM datatype name “Procedure, Performed”. Constrain to “completed” |
| code | [Procedure.code](StructureDefinition-us-quality-core-procedure-definitions.md#Procedure.code) | Identification of the procedure. Extensible binding to[US Core Procedure Codes](http://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/STU6.1/ValueSet-us-core-procedure-code.html) |
| id | [Procedure.id](StructureDefinition-us-quality-core-procedure-definitions.md#Procedure.id) |   |
| relatedTo | [Procedure.basedOn](StructureDefinition-us-quality-core-procedure-definitions.md#Procedure.basedOn) | A reference to a resource that contains details of the request for this procedure. There has not been a use case for this element in existing measures; therefore, it is not included in the US Quality Core profile Key Elements Table. |
| method | N/A | Procedure.method does not exist in FHIR. Rather than create an extension, US Quality Core’s approach is to assume the Procedure.code includes reference to the method, therefore, this element does not exist in the US Quality Core profile |
| rank | [Claim.procedure.sequence](StructureDefinition-us-quality-core-claim-definitions.md#Claim.procedure.sequence)) | Used to identify a principal procedure in the context of an encounter. See discussion in the QDM “Encounter, Performed” section indicating the rationale for using the Claim profile to identify principal or primary procedures and conditions. |
| priority | N/A | This QDM attribute is intended to reference elective from non-elective procedures. See discussion regarding “Encounter, Order” priority which was created to differentiate elective encounters from non-elective encounters. Similar to the encounter discussion, a given procedure is not inherently elective or non-elective, the urgency is based on a patient’s status and other factors. Information about urgency, elective, non-elective may be found a scheduling or appointment application which may generate a tag for a procedure in the clinical record. This item is not present in the FHIR Procedure resource. Measure developers should work with clinical sites to determine the most effective method for identifying procedure priority. |
| anatomicalLocationSite | [Procedure.bodySite](StructureDefinition-us-quality-core-procedure-definitions.md#Procedure.bodySite) | Target body sites with preferred binding to[SNOMEDCT Body Structures](http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/valueset-body-site.html). Existing measures have not provided a use case for this element. Therefore, the element does not appear in the US Quality Core profile Key Elements Table. |
| reason | [Procedure.reasonCode](StructureDefinition-us-quality-core-procedure-definitions.md#Procedure.reasonCode) | Code reason procedure is performed. Preferred binding to[Procedure Reason Codes](http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/valueset-procedure-reason.html) |
| result | [Simple Observation](StructureDefinition-us-quality-core-simple-observation.md)or[Observation Clinical Result](StructureDefinition-us-quality-core-observation-clinical-result.md)that includes the element[SimpleObservation.partOf](StructureDefinition-us-quality-core-simple-observation-definitions.md#Observation.partOf)to reference the procedure to which it applies. | [Procedure.report](StructureDefinition-us-quality-core-procedure-definitions.md#Procedure.report)references[DiagnosticReport-note](StructureDefinition-us-quality-core-diagnosticreport-note.md), DocumentReference, Composition (histology result, pathology report, surgical report, etc.); the latter two are not US Quality Core resources. However, based on feedback suggested that a procedure result might be better identified as[Simple Observation](StructureDefinition-us-quality-core-simple-observation.md)or[Observation Clinical Result](StructureDefinition-us-quality-core-observation-clinical-result.md)resources referencing the[SimpleObservation.partOf](StructureDefinition-us-quality-core-simple-observation-definitions.md#Observation.partOf)or[ObservationClinicalResult.partOf](StructureDefinition-us-quality-core-observation-clinical-result-definitions.md#Observation.partOf)element to reference the procedure to which it applies. |
| Negation Rationale | See Below |   |
| Relevant dateTime | [Procedure.performed[x] dateTime](StructureDefinition-us-quality-core-procedure-definitions.md#Procedure.performed[x]) | When the procedure was performed (as a single point in time). |
| Relevant Period | [Procedure.performed[x] Period](StructureDefinition-us-quality-core-procedure-definitions.md#Procedure.performed[x]) | When the procedure was performed (over a period of time). |
| Incision dateTime | [Procedure.extension:incisionDateTime](StructureDefinition-us-quality-core-procedure-definitions.md#Procedure.extension) | The first incision time. Existing measures do not use this element; therefore, it is not included in the US Quality Core profile Key Elements Table. |
| Author dateTime | [Procedure.extension:recorded](StructureDefinition-us-quality-core-procedurenotdone-definitions.md#Procedure.extension:recorded) | When the procedure was first captured in the subject’s record. This element is useful for historical procedures and for the QDM negation rationale concept. |
|   | [Procedure.usedReference](StructureDefinition-us-quality-core-procedurenotdone-definitions.md#Procedure.usedReference)[Procedure.usedCode](StructureDefinition-us-quality-core-procedure-definitions.md#Procedure.usedCode) | These elements help to add reference to a device, medication, or substance used as part of a procedure the US Quality Core element to address the device is used by the procedure. However, feedback has suggested that implementers prefer a direct, precoordinated code for the procedure that also indicates the type of device used rather than having to connect a specific item/device used to perform the procedure. Thus, while modeling allows usedCode or usedReference, feasibility is very limited. For that reason, these elements are not included in the US Quality Core profile Key Elements Table. |
| Components | N/A | Procedure does not include component. |
| Component code | N/A | N/A |
| Component result | N/A | N/A |
| Performer | [Procedure.performer.actor](StructureDefinition-us-quality-core-procedure-definitions.md#Procedure.performer.actor) | Although QDM includes this attribute it has not been used in existing measures and a clear use case has not been established. The original purpose for the QDM requester attribute was to designate the individual/organization responsible for reporting the measure results is the same individual/organization that requested the procedure or service. However, clinical software generally tracks the individual user entering data and linking that individual to a clinical role, a specialty, or an organization is not easily accomplished. |

##### Negation Rationale for Procedure, Performed

Use [US Quality Core ProcedureNotDone](StructureDefinition-us-quality-core-procedurenotdone.md), which contains:

* [Procedure.status](StructureDefinition-us-quality-core-procedurenotdone-definitions.md#Procedure.status) - With a value of "not-done" (as implied by the fixed value in the profile)

### Substance

#### Substance, Administered; Substance, Order; Substance Recommended

QDM defines Substance as a homogeneous material with a definite composition that includes allergens, biological materials, chemicals, foods, drugs and materials. QDM distinguishes between medications from non-medication substances by separately listing medication datatypes. Substance may or may not have a code or be classified by a code system such as RxNorm. Examples of a substance may include environmental agents (e.g., pollen, dust) and food (e.g., vitamins). Where a measure can use medication terminology (e.g., egg albumin) to represent QDM concept Substance, measure developers should consider expressing intent using the Substance mappings listed in this QDM-to-US Quality Core section.

Ideally, use of a substance-related resource should be driven by use cases and examples. Two such use cases currently exist in the quality measure community:

* Identifying blood products (a biological product in FHIR resources) ordered or administered within specific time relationships to other data elements – The FHIR Resource, [BiologicallyDerivedProduct](http://hl7.org/fhir/biologicallyderivedproduct.html), possibly using Procedure and ServiceRequest might have promise. However, the resource is still in development. Therefore, until further information is available, rather than expressing the QDM **datatype** Substance, Administration to address administration of blood transfusion, quality measure and clinical decision support (CDS) authors should consider using the procedure resource with a code representing transfusion.
* Determining exclusive newborn feeding with human breast milk during the initial stay in the hospital after birth – Currently, FHIR R4 includes a [NutritionOrder](http://hl7.org/fhir/nutritionorder.html) resource to reference a request for a specific diet, or supplements to a diet. However, a resource for documenting administration of nutrition-related substances is still in development. The focus of the FHIR R5 resource NutritionIntake is interoperable messaging between nutrition applications and the EHR (i.e., not EHR to EHR nutrition information sharing). Therefore, for this use case a quality measure or a clinical decision support (CDS) author could reference a NutritionOrder for an exclusive breast milk diet for the infant; however, such an expression could not reference clinical intake and output records to determine if anything other than human breast milk was administered to the infant. Summarizing discussion among HL7 workgroups in late 2023, the US Quality Core resource best suited to retrieve information about enteral intake is Observation (i.e., US Quality Core SimpleObservation). The following guidance may help measure developers trying to express retrieval of enteral intake data using SimpleObservation:

NOTE – There is no specific QDM datatype to address the [Nutrition Order](StructureDefinition-us-quality-core-nutritionorder.md) US Quality Core STU 6 profile. Since no current eCQM uses this profile, determination of key elements is challenging. The following table may help measure developers determine what to use for potential use cases:

| | | |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Substance, Order/Recommended - For Diet Orders** | [NutritionOrder](StructureDefinition-us-quality-core-nutritionorder-definitions.md#NutritionOrder) | Limited to orders for diets or diets with supplements |
| Substance Order/Recommended Activity | [NutritionOrder.status](StructureDefinition-us-quality-core-nutritionorder-definitions.md#NutritionOrder.status) | Determination of which order status is appropriate to retrieve, specifically constrain to active, completed.

| Substance, Order | [NutritionOrder.intent](StructureDefinition-us-quality-core-nutritionorder-definitions.md#NutritionOrder.intent) | Enables differentiation of order versus plan. Required binding to[RequestIntent](http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/valueset-request-intent.html). Constrain to “order” and child concepts |

### Symptom

QDM defines Symptom as an indication that a person has a condition or disease. Some examples include headache, fever, fatigue, nausea, vomiting, and pain. Symptoms are subjective manifestations of the disease perceived by the patient. As an example to differentiate symptom from finding, the patient’s subjective symptom of fever is distinguished from the temperature (a finding). For a finding, there is either a source of a temperature-measuring device together with a recorder of the device (electronically) or an individual (healthcare provider, patient, etc.).

Note: Definitions regarding symptom on the FHIR condition resource Boundaries and Relationships (Section 9.2.2: [http://hl7.org/fhir/condition.html](http://hl7.org/fhir/condition.html)):

* [The Condition] resource is not typically used to record information about subjective and objective information that might lead to the recording of a Condition resource. Such signs and symptoms are typically captured using the [Observation](http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/observation.html) resource; although in some cases a persistent symptom, e.g. fever, headache may be captured as a condition before a definitive diagnosis can be discerned by a clinician. By contrast, headache may be captured as an Observation when it contributes to the establishment of a meningitis Condition.
* Use the [Observation](http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/observation.html) resource when a symptom is resolved without long term management, tracking, or when a symptom contributes to the establishment of a condition.
* Use Condition when a symptom requires long term management, tracking, or is used as a proxy for a diagnosis or problem that is not yet determined.

Based on the FHIR referenced provided above, the QDM **datatype** Symptom maps to the FHIR Observation resource.

| severity | [Observation.interpretation](StructureDefinition-us-quality-core-simple-observation-definitions.md#Observation.interpretation) | Explanation of significance of the observation result (e.g., critical, high, low). |
| prevalencePeriod | [Observation.effective[x]](StructureDefinition-us-quality-core-simple-observation-definitions.md#Observation.effective[x]) | Time observation occurred if a point in time, or a period. Most likely Symptom will be recorded as a point in time. |
| recorder | [Observation.performer](StructureDefinition-us-quality-core-simple-observation-definitions.md#Observation.performer) | Although QDM includes this attribute it has not been used in existing measures and a clear use case has not been established. The original purpose for the QDM**performer**attribute was to designate the individual/organization responsible for reporting the measure results is the same individual/organization that performed the observation or task. However, clinical software generally tracks the individual user entering data and linking that individual to a clinical role, a specialty, or an organization is not easily accomplished. |
