# US Quality Core ModelInfo (Informational) - 2026 US Quality Core Implementation Guide v0.5.0

## US Quality Core ModelInfo (Informational)

> The Clinical Quality Language (CQL) artifacts, ModelInfo, libraries, and patterns referenced on this page are informational content included in this version of US Quality Core to support measure authoring, execution, and reporting tooling. They are not part of the conformance requirements of this guide and may evolve or be removed in future versions.

To support implementations using Clinical Quality Language (CQL) and US Quality Core, model information (ModelInfo) for this IG is provided in conformance with [Using ModelInfo](https://hl7.org/fhir/uv/cql/using-modelinfo.html) in the Using CQL with FHIR IG.

This implementation guide includes a [derived](https://hl7.org/fhir/uv/cql/using-modelinfo.html#derived-modelinfo) type [USQualityCore ModelInfo](assets/usqualitycore-modelinfo-0.5.0.xml) and corresponding [USQualityCore ModelInfo Library](Library-USQualityCore-ModelInfo.md) that provides model information for the profiles and extensions defined in US Quality Core. To use the US Quality Core model, include a using declaration as shown in the example below:

```
using USQualityCore version '0.5.0'

```

Although not required by CQL, current best-practice is to include the version of the model. For more information about how this library is constructed, refer to the [Using ModelInfo topic in the Using CQL with FHIR IG](https://hl7.org/fhir/uv/cql/using-modelinfo.html).
