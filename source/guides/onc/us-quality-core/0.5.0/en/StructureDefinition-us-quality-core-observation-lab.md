# US Quality Core Laboratory Result Observation - 2026 US Quality Core Implementation Guide v0.5.0

## Resource Profile: US Quality Core Laboratory Result Observation 

 
The US Quality Core Laboratory Result Observation Profile is based upon the US Laboratory Result Observation Resource. Defines the core set of elements and extensions for quality rule and measure authors. 

### USCDI+ Quality Element Support Expectations

Systems are expected to support this profile as part of implementing USCDI+ Quality V1 in FHIR and meeting the conformance requirements of this guide.

The following elements are specifically relevant to USCDI+ Quality V1 data classes and elements. Systems are expected to support these elements as applicable to their role in US Quality Core data exchange. See the [Must Support](must-support.md) section of this guide for more information. These elements are tagged as (USCDI+ Quality) in the formal profile views.

**USCDI+ Quality Elements:**

* status: (USCDI+ Quality) registered | preliminary | final | amended | corrected | entered-in-error | unknown
* category: (USCDI+ Quality) Classification of type of observation
* category:us-core: (USCDI+ Quality) (USCDI) Classification of type of observation
* code: (USCDI+ Quality) (USCDI) Laboratory Test Name
* issued: (USCDI+ Quality) Date/Time this version was made available
* value[x]: (USCDI+ Quality) (USCDI) Result Value
* interpretation: (USCDI+ Quality) High, low, normal, etc.

Because this profile is derived from US Core, systems are also expected to support Must Support requirements and (USCDI) tagged elements inherited from US Core. The [Formal Views](#profile) section also provides the formal summary, definitions, terminology requirements, and mandatory element requirements.

### Profile Specific Implementation Guidance

To represent that an observation of this type intentionally did not occur for a medical, patient, or system reason, use the [US Quality Core Observation Cancelled](StructureDefinition-us-quality-core-observationcancelled.md) profile.

**Usages:**

* Refer to this Profile: [US Quality Core DiagnosticReport Profile for Laboratory Results Reporting](StructureDefinition-us-quality-core-diagnosticreport-lab.md) and [US Quality Core DiagnosticReport Profile for Report and Note Exchange](StructureDefinition-us-quality-core-diagnosticreport-note.md)
* Examples for this Profile: [Observation/laboratory-result-observation-example-blood-glucose](Observation-laboratory-result-observation-example-blood-glucose.md)
* CapabilityStatements using this Profile: [US Quality Core Client CapabilityStatement](CapabilityStatement-us-quality-core-client.md) and [US Quality Core Server CapabilityStatement](CapabilityStatement-us-quality-core-server.md)
